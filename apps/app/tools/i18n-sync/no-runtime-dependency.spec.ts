// Requirement 4 (実行時の外部サービス非依存): the running GROWI application
// must never talk to POEditor itself — only the sync tooling in this
// directory (`apps/app/tools/i18n-sync/`), which runs from GitHub Actions,
// is allowed to call the POEditor API. If anyone ever imports
// `poeditor-client.ts` (or another file from this directory) into
// `apps/app/src/`, or hardcodes the POEditor domain into application code,
// the running app would gain a runtime dependency on POEditor's
// availability — exactly what Requirement 4 forbids.
//
// This is a drift test with no natural RED state: today `apps/app/src/`
// has zero references to POEditor, so this spec passes trivially on the
// current repository. Its entire value is as a regression guard — it must
// keep failing if such a reference is ever introduced. Do not "simplify"
// this away because it looks like it never fails.
//
// Two independent signals are scanned for, since a runtime dependency can be
// introduced either as a code import or as a hardcoded literal:
//
// 1. Any reference to the `i18n-sync` tooling directory (an import/require
//    specifier, or even a stray comment naming it) — catches
//    `import { uploadTerms } from '../../tools/i18n-sync/poeditor-client'`
//    and similar.
// 2. The POEditor domain string (`poeditor.com`) appearing literally —
//    catches a hardcoded API endpoint even without importing this directory,
//    e.g. `fetch('https://api.poeditor.com/v2/...')` written directly into
//    application code.
//
// A plain content scan (rather than the static-import-graph walker used by
// the `no-eager-*-imports.spec.ts` family — see
// apps/app/.claude/rules/server-boot-imports.md) is the right tool here:
// that walker only flags *external npm package* specifiers reached via
// static import, so a relative import such as
// `../../tools/i18n-sync/poeditor-client` — which is exactly the shape a
// real violation would take, since `i18n-sync` is a sibling directory
// under `apps/app/tools/`, not an npm package — would resolve as an
// ordinary internal file and never reach the walker's banned-pattern check.
// It also would not catch a hardcoded domain string that isn't an import at
// all. A direct content scan over every source file under `apps/app/src/`
// answers both cases without inventing a new resolution strategy.
