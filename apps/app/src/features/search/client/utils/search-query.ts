/**
 * Client-side search query model.
 *
 * The translation layer between the search-filter UI's structured state and the
 * flat inline query string the server's `parseQueryString`
 * (server/service/search.ts) consumes. These are pure functions: no React, no
 * network, no URL-encoding (that stays in the URL layer). `buildSearchQuery`
 * serializes structured state into the `?q=` string; `parseSearchQuery` recovers
 * it. The grammar deliberately mirrors the server tokenizer so the two never
 * disagree.
 *
 * Round-trip contract:
 *
 *   parseSearchQuery(buildSearchQuery(keyword, filters))
 *     deep-equals { keyword, filters }
 *
 * This holds when the keyword is normalized (trimmed, single-spaced) and free of
 * operator tokens, and the filter values are non-empty and free of double-quotes
 * (which `buildSearchQuery` strips, since the grammar cannot escape them, so a
 * value like `a"b` round-trips to its quote-free form `ab`). A keyword that itself
 * contains operator syntax (`author:foo`, a quoted phrase, …) is intentionally
 * NOT round-trip stable: on parse it is reinterpreted as a filter, since a
 * hand-typed operator is meant to hydrate the corresponding chip.
