 * Hit-tests pointer interactions inside the page body against the saved

 * (Requirements 2.1, 2.2, 2.6).
 *
 * Saved highlights have no DOM element of their own — they exist only as
 * `Range`s registered in `CSS.highlights` — so there is nothing to attach a
 * listener to. The events are therefore taken at the document level and
 * filtered to those originating inside `containerRef`'s subtree: taking them
 * on the container element itself would attach nothing when the ref is still
 * null on the first effect run, which is the normal case for a body container
 * rendered in the same commit.
 *
 * `pointermove` is coalesced to at most one hit test per animation frame, and
 * is only consulted at desktop width; at tablet-and-below width `click` (tap)
 * is the sole trigger. Both interactions are live at desktop width.
 *
 * The `not_found` anchors of Requirement 2.6 need no handling here: they are
 * already absent from `rangesById()`'s output, so they are never candidates.
 * Closing the popover on an outside click (Requirement 2.4) is not this hook's
 * job either — the popover renders outside the body container, so a
 * container-scoped hook structurally cannot see those clicks; its owner
 * (`InlineCommentBodyInteraction`) handles it.
