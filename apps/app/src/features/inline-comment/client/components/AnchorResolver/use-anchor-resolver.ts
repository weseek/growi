/**
 * Returns a value that keeps its previous identity across renders as long as

 * a new identity when the content genuinely changed.
 *
 * `anchors` comes from `useSWRxInlineComments`, which hands back a new array
 * reference on every revalidation even when the underlying comment list is
 * unchanged. Depending on `anchors` itself in a `useEffect` would therefore
 * re-run the effect (and re-`setResolved`, a new `Map` each time) on every
 * revalidation tick forever. Comparing content and reusing the previous
 * reference when it matches turns that into a dependency that only changes
 * when there is something new to recompute against.

/**
 * Resolves every origin comment's anchor against the currently rendered page
 * text, keyed by comment id (design.md: AnchorResolver > State Management).
 *
 * design.md's State Management describes recomputation as driven by
 * `useContainerSettle` alone. In practice a plain markdown page (no
 * lsx/drawio/mermaid widget) settles exactly once, at mount — before
 * `useSWRxInlineComments`'s list fetch has resolved, so `anchors` is still
 * `[]` at that point and the container never settles again (no rendering
 * element ever appears to re-arm `useContainerSettle`'s observer). Without a
 * second trigger, the real anchors that arrive later are never matched
 * against the DOM. This extends the design's "no persistent cache, always
 * recompute idempotently" principle to a second, independent trigger: an
 * effect that also recomputes whenever `anchors`' own content changes, not
 * only its reference (see `useStableByContent` above). That second trigger
 * resolves only while nothing is mid-render (`hasRenderingElements`); when the
 * list arrives first it defers to the settle signal instead of matching
 * against a half-built DOM.
 *
 * Recomputation itself is the same idempotent full-`Map` rebuild either way:
 * `renderedTextOf` is called once and `matchQuote` is run for each anchor,
 * producing a fresh `Map` that replaces the previous one. There is no
 * persistent cache — design.md's "解決済みオフセットキャッシュを持たない判断"
 * explicitly rejects one, so every trigger recomputes from scratch and the
 * result is thrown away and rebuilt, not patched in place.
 *
 * This hook only reads the DOM; it never writes to it. Highlight rendering
 * is `InlineCommentHighlight`'s separate responsibility.
 *
 * `anchors` is read fresh on every settle via the closure `useContainerSettle`
 * captures each render (it re-points its internal ref without re-subscribing
 * the observer) — so no extra memoization or locking is needed here either;
 * concurrent settle events just apply React's normal "last `setState` wins"
 * semantics, per design.md's explicit call-out that no extra lock is added.
 * The same "last write wins, no lock" semantics apply between the settle
 * callback and the anchors-content-change effect.
