 *
 * Checks once immediately so a container with no async widgets settles
 * right away. While rendering elements remain present, a later transition
 * back to zero would fire again — this backs the self-healing re-anchoring
 * described in design.md's System Flows ("次の静定検知で再計算が走り、
 * ハイライトのズレは自己修復される") — but that only applies within the
 * WATCH_TIMEOUT_MS window; see below.
 *
 * If rendering elements are still present after WATCH_TIMEOUT_MS, observation
 * stops (mirroring `watchRenderingAndReScroll`'s own timeout behavior:
 * disconnect the observer and clear all timers) and `onSettle` fires once as
 * a best-effort fallback, so the caller is never left waiting forever
 * (Requirements 2.1, 5.1; design.md's use-container-settle section: "監視を
 * 打ち切り、その時点のDOMに対して1回だけ...実行する").
 *
 * Returns a cleanup function that stops observation and clears timers.
