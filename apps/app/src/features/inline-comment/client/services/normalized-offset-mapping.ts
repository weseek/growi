 * - shrink: `"e" + U+0301` (2 code units) composes into `U+00E9` (1 code unit)
 * - grow:   `U+0958` (1 code unit) canonically decomposes into `U+0915 U+093C`
 *   (2 code units) and is not recomposed, because it is a composition exclusion
 *
 * Since the difference is not a constant, the two strings are walked in parallel from the
