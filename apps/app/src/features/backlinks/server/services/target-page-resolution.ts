/**
 * Resolves page IDs for a batch of paths.
 *
 * Inputs are split into permalinks (eg. '/6a4c8be9b698d2b7ab35cd6e') and regular
 * paths (eg. '/docs/new'). Permalinks are resolved by id; regular paths are
 * resolved the way the page-view route resolves a requested path
 * (`page-data-props.ts`): **a redirect on the path outranks a live page at it**,
 * and only a path with no redirect resolves to its own live page.
 *
 * Following the redirect is what keeps an inbound link valid when its target is
 * renamed and the *source* page is re-saved later: the source body still contains
 * the old path, so without it that re-resolution would report a working link as
 * broken. Matching page view's precedence is what keeps the two from disagreeing
 * when a path both has a live page and kept a redirect — which page creation is
 * supposed to prevent, but does so from a sub-operation that is not awaited and
 * swallows its own failure. A permalink needs none of this: it encodes the
 * target's immutable `_id`, so a rename cannot invalidate it.
 *
 * Cost: three concurrent queries (permalinks by id, paths by path, redirects for
 * every path), plus one more only for chain endpoints the path query did not
 * already cover.
 *
 * @param paths - Extracted deduped absolute paths and/or permalinks.
 * @returns - Map from the original input string to its resolved page ID. Keys are
 *            always the input, never a redirect endpoint, so a caller's stored
 *            `toPath` stays faithful to the page body.
 *            Inputs that resolve to no page are absent from the map.
