// The instructions text is the sole behavioral contract for the LLM. These
// assertions check that the four mandated policies (design.md "SummarizeAgent"
// Responsibilities & Constraints, points a-d) are present as concrete
// instructions, not that the LLM actually follows them (that is outside what
// a unit test can prove — see design.md's LLM Test Double Strategy).
//
// Each assertion below targets a PHRASE that spans the discriminating
// semantics (not a bare keyword), so a mutation that inverts or deletes the
// instruction's meaning turns the test RED even when the keyword itself
// survives elsewhere in the text. Verified by mutation-testing this suite
// against the implementation (see the task's review round 2 remediation):
// inverting "omit offset on the first call", deleting the
// hasMore===undefined warning, and deleting the totalLines-is-not-a-stop-
// condition bullet each independently turn at least one assertion RED.
