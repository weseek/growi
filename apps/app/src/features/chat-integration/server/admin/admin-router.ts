// Task 9.1's admin screen backend: the receiving end for the 3 things the
// admin screen has to show (design.md "管理画面と個人設定" -- Requirements
// 1.3, 1.4, 12.5) plus the write operations it exposes: Requirement 9.1's
// pairing submission (`submitPairingRequest`, task 7.3) and task 9.2's
// channel-permission settings save (`saveRelationSettings`, Requirements
// 11.1/11.2/11.4).
//
// Every endpoint here requires a real, logged-in GROWI ADMIN
// (`loginRequiredFactory` + `adminRequiredFactory`) -- same convention as
// `oauth-install-router.ts`'s `POST /state`. Ordinary logged-in-browser JSON
// requests, mounted under this feature's own apiv3 prefix
// (`server/index.ts`), outside `/peer/`.
//
// What this endpoint does NOT do, deliberately, per this task's own
// completion condition ("画面が出て、使える機能と連携の状態が読めることが試験で
// 示される" -- read-only for capabilities/status):
//   - It does not invent per-platform capability logic. `GET
//     /relations/:relationId/capabilities` relays `CapabilityReport` from
//     `fetchCapabilities` (task 7.1) VERBATIM -- no field is dropped,
//     renamed, or branched on by platform. The task's own text warns against
//     this ("独自に「このサービスはスラッシュコマンドが使える」等を決め打ちしない
//     こと").
//   - It does not build the "connect a new workspace via OAuth" flow. That
//     flow is not wired end to end yet (tasks.md's Implementation Notes on
//     task 9.0: the proxy-side authorization-URL endpoint and the
//     proxy→GROWI callback verification are both out of this spec's
//     boundary). The pairing operation this screen exposes is the
//     REGISTRATION-CODE mechanism instead (task 7.3's
//     `submitPairingRequest`), which needs no OAuth round trip at all --
//     `issueOAuthInstallState`/`verifyOAuthInstallState` (task 9.0) remain
//     unused by this router until that cross-repo wiring exists.

 * Turns one of this file's handlers into an Express handler that ALWAYS

 *
 * Express 4 does not look at what an `async` handler's promise does: a
 * rejection is neither passed to the error-handling middleware nor turned
 * into a response, so an unexpected throw anywhere inside a handler leaves
 * the request with no answer at all -- the browser waits until it gives up.
 * That is not hypothetical here: a settings save runs a MongoDB
 * transaction, and a transaction can be refused (see
 * `save-relation-settings.ts`'s `save-conflict`); a database that is
 * momentarily unavailable does the same to every other handler.
 *
 * So every route below is wrapped, once, here -- rather than each handler
 * growing its own `try`/`catch`, which is the arrangement one handler
 * eventually gets wrong. `500` because a throw reaching this point is by
 * definition not an outcome any handler recognised: the expected ones are
 * all returned as values and mapped to their own status codes.
