 * A handle naming one interaction's way of opening a modal, carried opaquely so
 * this app's non-`platform/` layers never see the Chat SDK's own
 * representation of it.
 *
 * It is deliberately **not** a platform trigger id. A modal can only be opened
 * by handing the form back to the SDK event that produced the interaction --
 * `platform/prompt.ts` explains why that is the only mechanism that works on
 * every service whose `modal` capability is `full` -- so `token` names that
 * event's own opener, held by `platform/` for as long as the interaction lasts.
 *
 * Included on `PlatformEvent`'s `mention` / `slash-command` / `action` kinds
 * (platform-event.ts) and consumed by `openModal(trigger: InteractionRef, ...)`.
 * Whether it still works is judged by the attempt itself, not by a field on
 * this type: `openModal` answers `false` when it does not.
