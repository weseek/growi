// This proxy's own signing keys, one set per relation (design.md's
// `RelationKeyService`, Requirements 9.5 / 9.6).
//
// Two properties are the reason this sits in `relation/` rather than in the
// storage layer:
//
//  - **A key belongs to one relation and to no other.** The keypair is minted
//    per relation, so one GROWI's private key leaking cannot be used against
//    any other GROWI the same workspace is paired with.
//  - **The key is written through the `DbClient` the caller supplied**, never
//    through a client this module reaches for itself. That is what lets
//    `PairingService` construct this service over the `tx` of its own
//    `$transaction`, alongside a `RelationRepository` over the same handle, and
//    get the `relation` row and its `own_key` row committed or rolled back
//    together (design.md: 「関係の行と鍵の行を同じトランザクションで書ける」).
//    The proxy mints `relationId` itself, so there is no ordering problem to
//    work around.
//
// **What leaves this layer is the means to sign, not key material.** The
// decrypted PEM exists only inside `own-key-repository`; `signerFor` returns
// the `KeyObject` that `sign()` takes, which callers hand on without ever
// unwrapping (Requirement 9.6).
