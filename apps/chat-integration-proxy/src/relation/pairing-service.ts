// The proxy's half of the pairing procedure (design.md's `PairingService`,
// Requirements 8.5, 9.1-9.5; protocol design.md's steps 1-6).
//
// This module is where trust between a chat workspace and a GROWI is
// established, so the order things happen in below is the security contract,
// not a matter of taste:
//
//  - **The declared URI is judged before anything is sent to it.** The proxy
//    reaches whatever URI a submission names, so an unjudged one turns this
//    endpoint into a way to probe a closed network from outside it. Judging is
//    `GrowiUriResolver`'s job (task 5.1), called here for its verdict.
//  - **Ownership is confirmed by a SIGNATURE, not by the challenge value
//    coming back.** Value equality alone proves only that whoever answered
//    knew the registration code. A third party who saw the code could submit
//    the REAL GROWI's URI together with THEIR OWN public key; the real GROWI
//    would answer step 5 honestly, the value would match, and the relation
//    would be established under the attacker's key. Verifying the signature
//    against the key submitted at step 3 is what closes that
//    (protocol design.md: 「⑤ が公開鍵を縛る理由」).
//  - **The answer's shape is checked before it is verified.** Step 5's answer
//    is the one thing this proxy accepts from a party it holds no key for, so
//    `parseChallengeResponse` is the only acceptance gate there is.
//  - **The order is consumed by a conditional write.** `pairing/submit` carries
//    neither a signature nor a nonce and is the most resendable entry point in
//    the protocol, so only the writer that flips `consumed_at` proceeds; every
//    other copy answers with the winner's result.
//
// **This module must not reach `growi/`** (design.md's dependency order), so
// the function that actually delivers the challenge arrives as a parameter.
// `orchestration/` composes it out of `GrowiUriResolver` and hands it in.
//
// What the administrator is told is deliberately thin: only the KIND of
// failure, never the peer's own words or the proxy's view of the network
// (design.md 「管理者に返すのは失敗の種類だけで、相手の応答の中身は返さない」).
