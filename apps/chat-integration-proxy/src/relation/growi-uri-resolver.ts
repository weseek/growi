// The proxy's half of the check on a GROWI URI a chat workspace declared
// (Requirements 9.2, 13.1). design.md, "申告された URL の検証は 2 つに割れている":
//
//   - **Judging the conditions** (https, default port, resolved address outside
//     the private ranges) belongs to `@growi/chat`'s `judgeGrowiUri`, which
//     touches no network and is not re-implemented here.
//   - **Resolving the name, connecting to the address that was judged, refusing
//     redirects and capping the wait** belongs to this file.
//
// Two properties are the point of the split:
//
//   - **The judgement runs on every request to a stored `growi_uri`, not only
//     at pairing time.** Judging once would let an operator declare a public
//     address, pass, and then point the name at a closed-network host -- the
//     exact move the check exists to stop.
//   - **The connection goes to the address that was just judged.** Letting the
//     socket resolve the name a second time would leave a window in which the
//     judged address and the connected address differ.
//
// `GrowiClient` (`growi/growi-client.ts`) must reach GROWI only through this
// module. A second place that builds HTTP requests is a second place the
// judgement can be missing from.
