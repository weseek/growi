// Public entry point of the `relation/` layer (design.md's File Structure
// Plan: 「この層の公開窓口」). Layers to the right of `relation/` import from
// here, never from the files below.
//
// Complete as of task 5.5, the last task of this layer: the five modules
// design.md lists under `relation/` are all built, and what is re-exported
// below is what `orchestration/` needs to hold them -- `GrowiUriResolver`,
// `RelationKeyService`, `GrowiSelector`, `PairingService`, and `UnpairService`
// -- plus the errors and the named limits a caller has to be able to name.
// Anything a module uses only on its own way to those (`buildPinnedRequestOptions`
// is the standing example) stays unexported on purpose.

// so that "the GROWI base path is applied once, not twice" is checked against
// the real joining rule instead of one re-derived inside the test. A test
// reaching past a barrel is not a caller: re-exporting it here would widen
// what `orchestration/` and `routes/` may reach for, which is exactly what
// this barrel exists to hold down.
