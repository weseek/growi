// Every signed request the proxy sends to a GROWI (design.md's `GrowiClient`,
// Requirements 3.1, 4.2, 5.2, 7.3, 9.2, 10.1, 11.4, 14.2).
//
// Five things below are the contract, not implementation taste:
//
//  - **Every send goes through `GrowiUriResolver.connect()`.** design.md:
//    「`GrowiClient` は必ず `GrowiUriResolver` を通す。直に `fetch` しない」 --
//    two places that build HTTP requests are two places the declared-URI
//    judgement can be missing from, and only one of them would be noticed.
//  - **The body is serialized exactly once.** `sign()` hashes the bytes it is
//    handed and the peer hashes the bytes it receives, so a body re-serialized
//    between signing and sending would differ in key order or number
//    formatting and be refused as tampered with. `JSON.stringify` runs once
//    here and the same value feeds both.
//  - **`op` is stamped by the method that was called**, never taken from the
//    caller's object. `op` is the only routing value the signature covers
//    (`covered-components.ts`), and the key registration / revocation bodies
//    carry a two-member `op` union whose other member is the GROWI -> proxy
//    direction; letting a caller's value through would let the wrong direction
//    be sent and `acceptEnvelope` would refuse it on arrival with nothing to
//    point at.
//  - **`relationId` is NOT stamped -- it is the caller's value, passed through
//    as-is.** The one value the caller supplied is what goes into the outgoing
//    body AND what `keyService.signerFor()` is asked for, so the signed
//    relation and the body's relation are the same value by construction (one
//    read, not two values compared). Pairing the right `relationId` with the
//    right `growiUri` for a given call is therefore entirely the CALLER's
//    responsibility: `GrowiClient` does not check that the two belong to the
//    same relation, and has nothing to check it against.
//  - **The answer is only ever a parsed value.** GROWI's answers carry no
//    signature (design.md: 「応答に署名は付かないので形の確かめが唯一の受け入れ
//    条件」), so the parse function is the whole acceptance gate. Nothing
//    reaches a caller without passing one.
//
// Retrying is the caller's decision (`FanOutCollector`, task 6.3): calling a
// method again with the SAME request object re-signs from scratch -- fresh
// nonce, fresh `created`/`expires` -- while the body bytes, and therefore
// `requestId` and `content-digest`, stay identical. A `SignResult` is never
// held past the one request it was made for.
