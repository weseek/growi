// design.md's File Structure Plan for this file: `fetchHistory` -- the
// conversation history a `keep` command turns into a page (Requirement 5.1 /
// 5.2), bounded by the `TimeRange` the user chose.
//
// Three things shape the implementation:
//
//  1. **A channel's own messages, not a thread's replies.** The SDK offers
//     both, and they answer different questions: `fetchMessages(threadId)`
//     walks the replies under one message, while `fetchChannelMessages`
//     (Slack's own comment: 「channel-level messages (conversations.history,
//     not thread replies)」) walks the conversation. `fetchHistory` takes a
//     `ChannelRef`, so it is the latter.
//  2. **No service can be asked for a time range**, only for a page and a
//     direction (`FetchOptions` carries `limit` / `cursor` / `direction` and
//     nothing else). So the range is applied here: pages are walked from the
//     newest backwards and the walk stops as soon as a page reaches back past
//     the start of the range.
//  3. **A failure the reader can act on is told apart from one they cannot.**
//     Requirement 5.4 asks for 「取得できない理由と、取得できるようにするために
//     必要な操作」, which is exactly `HistoryOutcome`'s `reason` plus `remedy`.
//     The recognition of *which* failure it is comes from `outbound.ts`, so
//     there is one answer for the whole layer rather than a second copy here
//     that can drift.
