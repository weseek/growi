// design.md's File Structure Plan for this file: 「modal の開閉」. Only the
// opening half exists -- neither the Chat SDK nor any of the four adapters
// offers a way to close a modal from the server, and design.md's own note on
// `openModal` says 「modal を開くだけ。送信は後から `modal-submit` として届く」:
// a modal closes when the reader submits or dismisses it.
//
// --------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Why a modal is opened through the event, not through the adapter
// --------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// design.md warned that 「『有効な手がかりがある』を `interaction != null` と
// 実装してはならない」 but still declared `openModal(trigger: InteractionRef, …)`
// with a platform trigger id behind it. Reading the installed SDK settles how
// the two fit together, and rules the adapter call out twice over:
//
//  1. **Teams has no `adapter.openModal` at all.** Of the four installed
//     adapters only `@chat-adapter/slack` implements that optional method.
//     Teams answers a modal inside the HTTP invoke response instead, through
//     `WebhookOptions.onOpenModal` -- a function that only exists for the
//     duration of the webhook call the SDK is currently serving.
//  2. **The SDK stores the modal's context before it opens anything.**
//     `SlashCommandEvent.openModal` / `ActionEvent.openModal` are closures the
//     SDK builds per event (`chat/dist/index.js`): each one mints a
//     `contextId`, saves the originating thread / channel under it, and only
//     then calls `onOpenModal` or `adapter.openModal`. The submission comes
//     back with that `contextId`, and the SDK resolves `relatedThread` /
//     `relatedChannel` from it. Calling `adapter.openModal` ourselves would
//     skip that save -- and `event-mapping.fromModalSubmit` (task 3.3) returns
//     `null` when a submission has neither, so **every submitted modal would
//     be silently dropped**.
//
// So the only correct mechanism is: hand the form back to the very event that
// produced the interaction. What `InteractionRef` carries is therefore a handle
// to that event's own `openModal` closure, not a platform trigger id -- which
// is exactly what makes Teams (`modal` = `full`, no trigger id) reachable.
//
// --------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Why the handle lives in memory and not in Postgres
// --------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// A closure cannot be written to a table, but that is not the reason -- the
// reason is that it never needs to be. `openModal` is called while the event
// that produced it is still being processed, on the instance processing it,
// inside the trigger's own lifetime (Slack's `trigger_id` lasts about three
// seconds; the Teams adapter gives a handler 5 seconds by default to answer a
// task/fetch). Nothing about it survives the request, so a short-lived
// in-process map with a time limit is the right shape and durable storage
// would be wrong. The *collection* the modal belongs to is the part that must
// survive, and that already lives in `pending_collection` keyed by the
// correlation id this module writes into the modal's `privateMetadata`.
