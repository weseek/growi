// The one composed app: every endpoint this proxy serves, mounted in one
// place -- tasks.md 8.5's 「この層の入口もここでまとめる」.
//
// **Why composition is a file of its own rather than `index.ts`.** `index.ts`
// is this layer's barrel, and every other barrel in this app is re-exports
// only. Building a value there would make the layer's public surface and its
// wiring the same file, and `routes/app.spec.ts` -- which drives a real app --
// would then be importing the barrel to test something the barrel is not.
//
// **The app is `Hono<SignedRequestEnv>`.** Three of the seven registrars need
// that environment for `c.get('verifiedKey')`; the other four are generic in
// their environment (Implementation Note 8.4 records why that shape was chosen)
// and take it unchanged. No cast anywhere.
//
// **Nothing is constructed here.** Every dependency arrives already built --
// `runtime/` owns configuration, repositories and the platform facade. This
// function only decides what is mounted, which is what
// `routes/app.spec.ts`'s guard sweep can then check against a real app rather
// than against a wiring the test wrote itself.
