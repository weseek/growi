// Reading and writing the chat workspaces this proxy is installed into
// (design.md's `installation` table).
//
// The surface below is shaped by its two declared consumers in design.md:
// `InstallationProvider` (`resolve` / `list`) and `InstallationStore`
// (`save` / `remove`). Both live in `platform/`, one layer to the right, and
// both are written against workspace-level vocabulary rather than row ids --
// which is why `save` upserts on `(platform, workspaceId)` instead of taking
// an id, and why `resolveCredentials` is addressed the same way.
//
// `credentials` is the encrypted column. Every function below either encrypts
// on the way in or decrypts on the way out; no function returns the stored
// ciphertext, and no other layer is given the cipher's key (`SecretCipher` is
// two functions, see types/secret-cipher.ts).
