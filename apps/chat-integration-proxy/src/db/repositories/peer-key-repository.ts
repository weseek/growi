// The GROWI side's public keys for one relation (design.md's `peer_key` table).
//
// Two invariants shape this file.
//
//  - **A key is always addressed by `KeyRef`, never by `keyId` alone.** `keyId`
//    is chosen by the key's owner, so two GROWI instances paired with the same
//    workspace may well have picked the same one; resolving by `keyId` alone
//    would verify one relation's signature against another relation's key
//    (`@growi/chat`'s key-identity.ts, Requirement 10.5/10.6).
//  - **This table holds the peer's keys only.** `resolvePublicKey` in
//    `routes/signature-guard.ts` wraps this repository precisely because it must
//    never reach this proxy's own keys -- if it could, a request signed with our
//    own key would verify against it and a reflection would succeed
//    (design.md's SignatureGuard section). Keeping the two sides in separate
//    tables, and this repository reading only one of them, is what makes that
//    structural rather than a rule someone has to remember.
