// must normalize to the same thing).
//
// Only the two `PlatformEvent` kinds that can start a command reach this
// function; `modal-submit` / `action` / `link-posted` are handled elsewhere
// (design.md's イベントの振り分け table) and are excluded from the parameter
// type itself rather than handled with a `null`/throw branch here, so a
// caller passing the wrong kind is a compile-time error, not a runtime one.
//
// This function only splits text -- it does not decide whether the result
// names a real command. An empty `commandName` (nothing followed the
// address, or a slash command registered with empty text) is a valid,
// non-throwing outcome: rejecting an unrecognized or empty `commandName` is
// `CommandSet`'s job (a later task), not this one's.
