// `AdminCommandSet` -- design.md's Components and Interfaces row for this
// file: 「運用者の入り口（**文字列の解釈と結果の組み立てだけ**）」.
//
// The five things an operator can type (design.md's AdminCommandSet table):
// `register`, `unregister`, `weight <growi> <値>`, `rotate-key`, and
// `rotate-key status`.
//
// WHAT THIS FILE DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO. design.md: 「この部品は文字列の
// 解釈と結果の組み立てだけを持つ。4 つの操作の中身はすべて右側の層にある
// （`register`/`unregister` は `relation/`、`rotate-key` は `relation/` と
// `growi/`）ので、ここから直に呼ぶと宣言した依存の向き（`command → relation
// → growi`）を逆走する。実際の呼び出しは `orchestration/` が行い、この部品は
// 呼ぶべき操作と引数を値として返す」. So `parseAdminCommand` returns a plain
// data description of the operation to run -- never a callable, never a
// partially applied service call -- and this file imports nothing from
// `relation/`, `growi/`, or `orchestration/`.
//
// Everything an intent needs that only the surrounding context knows (which
// installation, which relation, which channel) is deliberately absent: the
// operator types `rotate-key` at a workspace, and `RelationKeyService.rotate`
// takes an `installationId` design.md says is resolved from the workspace the
// command was typed in. Resolving that is orchestration's step, not a value
// this parser can invent.
