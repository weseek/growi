// This layer's public entry point -- 「この層の入口もここでまとめる」
// (tasks.md 4.4), the same shape `db/index.ts` and `platform/index.ts` already
// take for their own layers. Everything `relation/`, `growi/`,
// `orchestration/` and `routes/` may see of `command/` is exported from here;
// nothing else in this directory is part of its contract.
//
// The whole public surface of all four modules is re-exported, and that is
// deliberate rather than lazy: orchestration is the only external caller, and
// it needs each of them -- `normalize` to turn an event into an `Invocation`,
// `COMMAND_TRAITS` to look up what that command collects and how its target is
// chosen, the admin words to route an operator's command, and
// `ArgumentCollector` to collect and resume. What is NOT here is what stayed
// unexported in each module (its internal helpers, e.g. the argument-line
// parser and the `pending_collection` state shape), which is where this
// layer's implementation detail actually lives.
