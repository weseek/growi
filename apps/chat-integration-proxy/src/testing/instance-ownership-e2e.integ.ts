// Task 11.4 -- who owns what when more than one proxy instance is running,
// driven against a real PostgreSQL.
//
// **This file is EXPECTED to be red in this devcontainer**, for the same
// reason `harness-round-trip.integ.ts`, `command-flow-e2e.integ.ts` and
// `notification-linking-e2e.integ.ts` are: the `postgres` hostname does not
// resolve here (Implementation Note 1.2). There is deliberately no
// `beforeAll` -- a failing `beforeAll` SKIPS the bodies, so not one assertion
// below would ever be parsed while storage is unreachable.
//
// **What this file traces to.** tasks.md lists 「_Requirements: 1.1, 1.4,
// 8.1_」 for this task, and two of those three do not say what the task's
// bullets say. Requirement 1.4 is about carrying on with the OTHER chat
// services when one service's processing fails unexpectedly -- failure
// isolation across services, which `connection-manager.ts` gets right by
// reconciling each unit inside its own `try`, and which is task 3.8's to
// prove, not this one's. Requirement 8.1 is about binding several GROWIs to
// one chat workspace and has nothing to do with how many proxy instances run.
// Of the three only Requirement 1.1 applies, and only through its 「その
// サービスに対して機能を提供する」: a service is served exactly when its
// connection is open, and this file's subject is that it is open ONCE.
// 「持ち分」 itself is a design.md constraint --「**水平に増やせる状態を保
// つ。** … Chat SDK が要求する分散ロックと重複排除は `state-pg` が担う」--
// with no acceptance criterion of its own in requirements.md. See this task's
// Implementation Note.
//
// **Everything under test here is decided in PostgreSQL, not in this
// process.** `@chat-adapter/state-pg` grants a lock by inserting a row and
// refusing the insert while an unexpired one exists; it extends a grant only
// for the token that holds it; it deletes a grant only by that same token. So
// two instances started in one process contend for exactly the grant a real
// pair of processes would (Implementation Note 11.1) -- which is why the
// instances below are started with the REAL `createPlatformFacade` and NOT
// with `fake-chat-service.ts`, whose `locks()` never contends
// (Implementation Note 11.1 (b)).
//
// **Which service each of task 11.4's bullets is actually about.**
// `CONNECTION_UNIT_TABLE` (`capabilities/`) is the only place that decides
// this, and it reads: Slack and Discord `per-app`, Mattermost
// `per-installation`, **Teams `none`**. So the 「installation ごとのサービス」
// bullet is about MATTERMOST, not about Teams -- Teams dials in over a
// webhook and never becomes a connection unit at all, so there is no
// per-installation ownership of it to check. Nor is the sweeper an
// alternative reading of that bullet: its lock is one global `proxy:sweep`
// key, not one key per installation.
//
// **Why Discord can be driven through the completely real facade.** Its
// adapter's `initialize()` only resolves an application id, and a literal
// `applicationId` is already resolved, so opening the `app:discord` unit
// touches no network and exposes no `disconnect()` to fail on either. That is
// the same fact Implementation Note 3.8 (d) records as a Revalidation Trigger
// candidate -- **if Discord ever gains a real Gateway connection, the cases
// below that use the real facade have to move to the injected-dial mechanism
// the Mattermost cases already use.**
//
// **Why the Mattermost cases inject `open`/`close`.** Its adapter's
// `initialize()` fetches `/api/v4/users/me` and then opens a WebSocket, and
// this app has no WebSocket server library to answer that with. So those
// cases keep the real Postgres-backed lock, the real `ConnectionManager` and
// the real `CONNECTION_UNIT_TABLE`, and substitute ONLY the socket dial --
// which is the seam `connection-manager.ts` was given `open`/`close` for in
// the first place. What they prove is the part a live Mattermost would not
// add to: that the per-installation key is owned by exactly one instance.
