// A chat service that pushes events into the proxy and keeps everything the
// proxy sends back (tasks.md 11.1's 「偽のチャットサービス -- 4 サービス分の
// イベントを流し込み、投稿を受け取れるもの」).
//
// TEST INFRASTRUCTURE, NOT PRODUCTION SURFACE -- see `signing-identity.ts`.
//
// **It stands in for `createPlatformFacade`, not for a chat service's wire
// protocol.** `startProxy` takes `createFacade` as an override precisely so a
// test can drive the whole app without four live connections (Implementation
// Note 9.1); this file is that override. What it does NOT exercise is
// `platform/event-mapping.ts` -- see `chat-events.ts` for why that boundary is
// where it is.
//
// **The distributed lock is deliberately absent here.** `locks()` answers a
// lock that never contends, which is right for 11.2/11.3 and wrong for 11.4:
// the ownership rules 11.4 checks live in PostgreSQL, so that task must start
// its instances with the REAL facade and leave this one out of the way. The
// cluster passes overrides through per instance so both are possible.
