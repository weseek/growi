# Implementation Plan

> **Organized by story, not by architectural layer.** The five stories (B1–B5) are vertical,
> shippable slices; this plan is sequenced so each story is a **contiguous block** you can build and
> verify end-to-end before starting the next — no skipping around. B1 carries the shared foundation
> (model, indexes, extractor, service, read path, panel) because the first vertical slice always
> carries the walking skeleton; B2–B5 graft onto it.
>
> **Where a capability was split across stories**, the task notes call it out explicitly:
> `resolveToPageIds`, the sync ops, the lifecycle handlers, the read queries, `BacklinkListItem`,
> `BacklinksPanel`, and the event subscription each get their B1 half here and their B4/B5 half in
> the later story.
>
> **Manual-implementation guide.** This plan is written to be worked by hand as a checklist (not via
> `/kiro-impl`). Each task states what to build, a **Done when** acceptance line, the requirements it
> satisfies, the **Boundary** (the symbol/module it lands in — see design.md § File Structure Plan),
> and its dependencies. Tasks with no dependency between them can be done in any order.
>
> **Story independence:** B2 (scale — read-path perf + write-path burst control), B3 (backfill),
> B4 (rename/move), and B5 (delete/broken) are all independent of one another — each depends only on
> B1. Do them in whatever order you like after B1.

## Story B1 — See which pages link here (all link forms, permission-filtered)

**Nature:** Foundation. Introduces the `PageLink` collection, the extractor, the live create/edit
sync, the permission-filtered read, the API, and the panel. All five link forms (Markdown, wiki-link,
raw HTML anchor, permalink `/{id}`, same-host absolute URL) ship together — the design builds
extraction and resolution for all of them as one unit; there is no separable "naive query" or
"wiki-links later" stage. Lifecycle coverage is **create/update only**.

- [x] B1.1 Define backlinks interfaces and shared types
  - Define the `IPageLink` edge shape (`fromPage`, `toPath`, `toPage`) and the incoming-backlinks DTO
    `IBacklink` (page id + path; always healthy)
  - **B1 scope: the outgoing-health types are deferred to B5.** `ILinkTarget` (page id + path +
    required target state) and the `LinkTargetState` union (`normal` / `trashed` / `broken`) are
    declared by the tasks that first produce them — the union in **B5.1** (with its derivation helper)
    and the DTO in **B5.4** (with the forward-health read). The design's DTO section (§ Data Models)
    remains the target shape. _Revised from the original plan, which declared both up front in B1.1;
    B1 shipped without them, and introducing a type in the story that produces it keeps the type and
    its only producer in one reviewable change._
  - Done when the types compile and are importable by both server and client code
  - _Requirements: 1.8_

- [x] B1.2 Implement the PageLink model with indexes and the B1 statics
  - Create the Mongoose model following the `PageTagRelation` precedent (`getOrCreateModel`)
  - Declare indexes `{fromPage}`, `{toPath}`, `{toPage}` and the **unique** `{fromPage, toPath}`
    index that enforces "one source listed once"
  - `PageLink` is a **new** collection, so the four indexes are created from these schema
    declarations by Mongoose `autoIndex` at model registration — no migrate-mongo migration is
    needed (same as the `PageTagRelation` precedent, whose unique compound index is schema-declared
    with no migration). A migration would only be required to *drop/alter* an index later.
  - Implement the two statics B1 needs: replace-outbound and find-backlink-sources. You may declare
    the typed signatures for re-resolve-by-path (implemented in B4) and reconcile-deleted
    (implemented in B5) now, but do not implement them here
  - Done when the model registers, its indexes exist, and a unit test confirms the unique index
    rejects a duplicate `{fromPage, toPath}` insert
  - **Superseded after this task shipped (do not act on the Mongoose text above).** `pagelinks` was
    moved to a **Prisma-only** model — `Prisma.defineExtension` in `server/models/page-link.ts`, no
    mongoose schema, no `getOrCreateModel`. Consequently the "no migrate-mongo migration is needed"
    claim is now false: `prisma db push` is never run, so the indexes are provisioned by
    `migrations/20260901064500-add-indexes-to-pagelinks.js`, and `server/models/page-link-indexes.ts`
    repeats the list for the integ harness (which skips migrations on in-memory MongoDB). Three
    indexes exist, not four — unique `fromPage_1_toPath_1`, `toPage_1`, `toPath_1`; there is no
    standalone `fromPage_1` (the compound's prefix serves it). See design.md § PageLink model
    (State Management) for the current contract, and B5.1 for what this means for reconcile
  - _Requirements: 1.5, 3.4_
  - _Depends: B1.1_

- [x] B1.3 Implement internal-link extraction from a page body — all link forms
  - Build a pure function that takes a Markdown body, the page's path, and the wiki's site URL, and
    returns a deduplicated list of resolved internal page paths, reusing the existing remark/rehype
    link plugins (pukiwiki + relative-links) in a trimmed server processor
  - Recognize standard Markdown, wiki-link (`[[alias>/path]]`), and raw-HTML anchors; classify
    scheme-bearing absolute URLs by host (same host as the configured site URL → keep its path
    component; different host → external; site URL unset → no absolute URL is internal); exclude
    in-page `#` anchors and links inside code spans/blocks; strip query/anchor; normalize paths;
    gate on `isCreatablePage`; pass page-permalink (`/{id}`) targets through unchanged; drop the
    page's own-**path** self-link only (a link to the page's own permalink cannot be detected here —
    the extractor has no page `_id` — and is dropped later at sync, task B1.5)
  - Done when unit tests cover each link form and each exclusion rule, plus a same-host absolute URL
    kept as its path, a different-host URL and a (site-URL-unset) absolute URL both excluded, and a
    permalink returned verbatim; the deduped result excludes the page's own-path self-link
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, 1.9, 1.10, 1.11_
  - _Boundary: extractInternalLinkPaths_
  - _Depends: B1.1 (independent of B1.2)_

- [x] B1.4 Implement target-page resolution — direct path + permalink only
  - Build the live-path resolver: a **permalink** path (`/{id}`) resolves directly to that page id
    with no path lookup or redirect-following; otherwise a path resolves by direct path lookup, else
    null. A permalink to a non-existent id also resolves to null
  - **B1 scope: no redirect-chain following.** Following the redirect chain to its endpoint (for
    renamed/moved targets, multi-hop A→B→C) is deferred to **B4.1**. In B1, a link to a page that has
    since moved resolves to null until B4 is built — acceptable for the create/update-only slice
  - Done when unit tests cover a direct path hit, a permalink resolving by id, and both null cases
    (no page at path; no page with that id)
  - _Requirements: 1.9_
  - _Boundary: resolveToPageIds_
  - _Depends: B1.1 (independent of B1.2, B1.3)_

- [x] B1.5 Implement the index synchronization operations — replace-outbound + self-drop only
  - Implement the row operation on top of the model: replace a source page's outbound rows from a
    freshly extracted+resolved set, **dropping any resolved row whose target is the source page
    itself** (covers a page linking to its own permalink, and any alias that resolves back to the
    source — the self-permalink half of 1.6)
  - **B1 scope:** skip reconcile-deleted (B5.2) and re-resolve-by-path (B4.2)
  - Done when unit tests show replacing outbound rows is idempotent and excludes a self-permalink row
  - _Requirements: 1.6, 3.1, 3.2_
  - _Boundary: page-link-sync, PageLink_
  - _Depends: B1.2, B1.3, B1.4_

- [x] B1.6 Implement the create/update lifecycle handlers in the backlinks service
  - Implement the service handlers for create and update: re-extract the body and replace the source
    page's outbound rows via B1.5. The service reads the configured site URL and passes it into
    extraction (so same-wiki absolute URLs are recognized), keeping the extractor itself config-free.
    Read the body from the latest revision when the event payload lacks it
  - Handlers are idempotent and tolerate missing/empty bodies
  - **B1 scope:** create does **not** re-resolve inbound matches here — repointing stale caches when
    a page appears at a previously-occupied path is deferred to **B4.3**. Skip the delete-family
    handlers (B5.3)
  - Done when unit tests invoke the create and update handlers with a fake event payload and assert
    the resulting row changes (created/replaced), including a same-wiki absolute link recorded as an
    internal row
  - _Requirements: 1.10, 1.11, 3.1, 3.2_
  - _Boundary: PageLinkService_
  - _Depends: B1.5_

- [x] B1.7 Implement the permission-filtered read query — findBacklinks only
  - Implement `findBacklinks` (sources pointing at a page, filtered to readable, non-trashed pages
    via the shared viewer/grant filter, mapped to `IBacklink`)
  - Never return unfiltered paths; any count is derived only from the filtered set
  - **B1 scope:** skip `findForwardLinkHealth` (B5.4)
  - Done when integration tests show restricted source pages are omitted from results, and the query
    returns the readable, non-trashed sources as `IBacklink` DTOs
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4_
  - _Boundary: PageLinkService_
  - _Depends: B1.2_

- [x] B1.8 Add the backlinks read endpoint
  - Add an authenticated apiv3 GET route that validates a page id, resolves the viewer from the
    request, and returns the permission-filtered backlinks for that page
  - Done when the endpoint returns backlinks for a readable page and 400/403 for invalid id /
    no-access, delegating filtering to the service
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.1, 6.4_
  - _Boundary: getBacklinksHandlerFactory (routes/backlinks.ts)_
  - _Depends: B1.7_

- [x] B1.9 Add the client data hook
  - Add an SWR hook keyed by page id (and guest state) that fetches from the backlinks endpoint and
    returns the backlink list
  - Done when the hook returns data for a page and revalidates when the page id changes
  - _Requirements: 1.1_
  - _Boundary: useSWRxBacklinks_
  - _Depends: B1.8_

- [x] B1.10 Build the backlink list-item component — title + path only
  - Build a presentational row showing a linked page's title and path (reusing existing page-path
    label components)
  - **B1 scope:** skip the trashed/broken target-state badge (B5.5)
  - Done when the component renders title + path for a normal link
  - _Requirements: 1.8_
  - _Boundary: BacklinkListItem_
  - _Depends: B1.1_

- [x] B1.11 Build the backlinks panel — incoming list + empty state
  - Build the panel that lists incoming links via the hook and renders an explicit empty state when
    there are none
  - **B1 scope:** skip the secondary "outgoing links needing attention" forward-health section (B5.6)
  - Done when the panel shows the backlink list and the empty state when there are no backlinks
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.7, 1.8_
  - _Boundary: BacklinksPanel_
  - _Depends: B1.9, B1.10_

- [x] B1.12 Subscribe the service to create/update lifecycle events
  - Instantiate and initialize the backlinks service in the server setup phase (mirroring the search
    service), subscribing its handlers to create/update only; do not modify the page service
  - **B1 scope:** skip the delete-family subscriptions (delete/deleteCompletely/
    syncDescendantsDelete) — B5.7
  - Done when creating and editing a page through the app changes `PageLink` rows accordingly
    (verified by B1.15's lifecycle integration test)
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2_
  - _Boundary: crowi setup, PageLinkService_
  - _Depends: B1.6_

- [x] B1.13 Register the backlinks endpoint
  - Register the read route in the apiv3 router
  - Done when the endpoint is reachable over HTTP and returns backlinks for a seeded page
  - _Requirements: 1.1_
  - _Boundary: apiv3 router_
  - _Depends: B1.8 (independent of B1.12)_

- [x] B1.14 Add the Backlinks tab to the page accessories UI
  - Add a Backlinks entry to the page-accessories tab mapping that renders the panel
  - Done when opening the tab on a page displays the backlinks panel
  - _Requirements: 1.1_
  - _Boundary: PageAccessoriesModal_
  - _Depends: B1.11_

- [x] B1.15 Integration tests (B1 slice)
  - Cover: create/update add and remove backlinks; backlinks exclude pages the viewer cannot read and
    reflect grant changes; a source linking B→A more than once is listed once; a page linking to its
    own permalink is excluded from its own backlinks
  - **B1 scope:** skip rename/move (B4.4) and trash/delete/restore (B5.8) scenarios
  - Done when these scenarios pass against the wired service through real create/update lifecycle calls
  - _Requirements: 1.6, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 3.1, 3.2_
  - _Depends: B1.12, B1.13_

- [x] B1.16 E2E test for the backlinks panel (B1 slice)
  - Verify the Backlinks tab lists linking pages with title + path, and shows the empty state when
    none exist
  - **B1 scope:** skip trashed/deleted-target-indicator assertions (B5.8)
  - Done when the E2E flow passes for the populated and empty cases
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.7, 1.8_
  - _Depends: B1.14_

## Story B2 — Backlinks at scale (read-path perf + write-path burst control)

**Nature:** Two independent slices cleaved along the read/write seam, each depending only on B1:
**B2.1** is a read-path validation — a pure benchmark proving the `{toPage}` index and viewer filter
return backlinks in interactive time on a static ~100k-page dataset (no production code change
expected). **B2.2** is a write-path production change — grafting an in-process coalescing + pacing
queue onto the B1 walking-skeleton listener so bursts of saves don't storm MongoDB or block live
reads. Read-side query latency is independent of write pacing, so the two share no dependency.

**Recommended sequence: B2.2 before B2.1.** B2.2 ships real production behavior that protects the
write path today; B2.1 is a read-only benchmark on static data that can run at any time and mainly
confirms B1's index choice. (Not a hard dependency — either order is correct.)

- [x] B2.1 Performance check for backlinks retrieval at scale (read-path)
  - A measurement exercise, not a feature build: prove Req 3.4's target and locate any bottleneck
    while it is still a cheap, pre-merge index fix. Pure read benchmark on a statically seeded
    dataset — independent of B2.2's write pacing.
  - **Seed** ~100k pages with realistic internal linking, deliberately including a **heavily-linked
    hub page** (thousands of inbound sources) — the worst case for the read path and the page you
    actually measure. Use a throwaway/fixture seeding script, **not** the B3 backfill job.
  - **Confirm the indexes exist** on the seeded collection (created by B1.2 `autoIndex`) — a check,
    not new work. The collection carries exactly two: `{toPage}` (what this benchmark exercises, via
    `findBacklinkSources`) and the unique `{fromPage, toPath}` compound. The standalone `{fromPage}`
    and `{toPath}` indexes were dropped in B2.2 as unused, so their absence is expected, not a gap —
    `{fromPage}` is the compound's prefix, and `toPath`-alone gets its index in B4 with the query
    that needs it.
  - **Measure the real read path** for the hub page **as a viewer**: the full `findBacklinks` →
    `findBacklinkSources` (`distinct` on `{toPage}`) → permission/viewer filter path, not the raw
    Mongo query alone. Confirm it returns in interactive time (<~1s).
  - **Inspect the query plan** (`explain()`) on the `distinct` and the viewer-filter query to confirm
    they use an index rather than collection-scanning — this is what tells you *why* the number is
    what it is, and *where* to fix it if it is slow.
  - **Confirm the no-rescan guarantee** by inspection/a targeted check: a single create/edit rewrites
    only that page's rows (the `replaceOutboundLinks` bulkWrite) and never walks all pages.
  - If the target is missed, the `explain()` output points at the fix (usually a missing/compound
    index or a filter restructure); that fix — an index/query change only — is then part of this task.
  - **Decision made:** an env-gated integ test, not a CI test and not a standalone script —
    `server/services/page-link-read-perf.integ.ts`. It is collected by the normal
    `app-integration` project but every test is skipped unless `BACKLINKS_PERF` is set, so CI never
    pays the seed, while the measurement stays runnable/repeatable in-tree and reuses the crowi test
    harness (so it measures the real `findBacklinks`, with no hand-rolled model bootstrap to drift).
  - Done when a measured retrieval against the ~100k-page dataset meets the <~1s target, the
    `explain()` evidence shows the query is index-backed, and the no-rescan guarantee is confirmed
    (plus any surfaced index/query fix is applied)
  - _Requirements: 3.4_
  - _Depends: B1.12, B1.13_

  **Result — measured 2026-07-31. Target met with ~8x headroom; no index/query fix needed.**

  How to reproduce:
  ```
  MONGO_URI=mongodb://mongo:27017/growi?replicaSet=rs0 \
    BACKLINKS_PERF=1 pnpm vitest run page-link-read-perf
  ```
  (The harness rewrites the db name to `growi_test_<workerId>`, so the dev `growi` database is never
  touched. `BACKLINKS_PERF_PAGES` / `BACKLINKS_PERF_INBOUND` override the scale.) Safe against the
  shared devcontainer mongod — the warm runs only read and write their own database. The cold-cache
  run is **not**; it needs the separate procedure below.

  Environment: devcontainer MongoDB 8.2.9, wiredTiger, `rs0` single-node replica set, 16 cores /
  15.9 GB. Dataset: 100,001 pages, 205,000 link rows, hub page with 5,000 inbound sources. Pages
  carry the full real field set (`revision`, `creator`, `lastUpdateUser`, `parent`, `seenUsers`, …),
  giving a **427 B average document** against the 384 B seen in a real wiki — document size is what
  the FETCH-and-project read actually pays, so a stripped 185 B page would have understated it.

  Hub sources are mixed so the viewer filter really sifts: 60% public, 10% granted to a group the
  viewer belongs to, 10% granted to a group they don't, 10% owned by someone else, 5% owned by the
  viewer, 5% trashed ⇒ 3,750 of 5,000 visible. The viewer is a member of two real `UserGroup`s, so
  `generateGrantCondition` emits its `grantedGroups: {$elemMatch: …}` branch — without groups seeded
  that branch is omitted and the measured query would be structurally simpler than a real member's.
  The visible count is asserted, so this doubles as a correctness check at scale.

  | measurement | 5,000 inbound | 20,000 inbound |
  |---|---|---|
  | `findBacklinks` (full read path) | **median 128 ms** (min 122 / max 138) | **median 192 ms** (min 168 / max 216) |
  | └ `findBacklinkSources` (`distinct` on `{toPage}`) | median 7 ms | median 29 ms |
  | └ viewer-filtered `Page` query | median 115 ms | median 150 ms |

  One run's samples; repeated runs land at a 116–130 ms median for the 5,000-inbound case, with the
  max the noisy figure since the devcontainer shares its CPU. Read the medians as ~an order of
  magnitude under the target, not as a precise figure to regression-test against.

  **Cold cache** (`BACKLINKS_PERF_COLD=1` shrinks the server's WiredTiger cache below the working set,
  then restores it) — answers what happens when the pages are *not* already in memory:

  | cache vs working set | first read | settled median |
  |---|---|---|
  | 64 MiB vs 80 MiB (1.25x) | 163 ms | 128 ms |
  | 8 MiB vs 155 MiB (19x) | 141 ms | **164 ms** |

  Even with the cache 19x too small to hold the data, the read is 164 ms — still ~6x under target. So
  the warm figures are not an artifact of everything being cache-resident.

  **Never run the cold-cache test against the shared devcontainer mongod.** It shrinks the cache with
  `setParameter: {wiredTigerEngineRuntimeConfig: 'cache_size=…M'}`, which is **process-wide** — the
  `growi_test_<workerId>` database isolation that makes the warm runs safe does not apply. The restore
  is a `finally`, so it survives a failing assertion but not the process being killed (Ctrl-C, a
  vitest timeout kill, the container stopping). Killed mid-run against the shared instance, mongod
  keeps the 64 MiB cache until it is restarted, silently slowing every later dev request, integ test,
  and benchmark run — including the next run of this very test, which would then report a degraded
  baseline as if it were the real number.

  So give it a throwaway mongod of its own, and let discarding the container be the restore. The
  devcontainer has no `docker` CLI and `mongo` is a sibling compose service, so the container is
  started **from the host**, attached to the devcontainer's network so the test can reach it by name:
  ```
  # on the host — network name follows the compose project, so look it up rather than guessing
  docker network ls --filter name=default
  docker run --rm -d --name mongo-b21-cold --network <that-network> \
    mongo:8.2 --replSet rs0 --bind_ip_all
  docker exec mongo-b21-cold mongosh --quiet --eval 'rs.initiate()'
  ```
  ```
  # in the devcontainer — note the host is mongo-b21-cold, NOT the shared mongo
  MONGO_URI=mongodb://mongo-b21-cold:27017/growi?replicaSet=rs0 \
    BACKLINKS_PERF=1 BACKLINKS_PERF_COLD=1 pnpm vitest run page-link-read-perf
  ```
  ```
  # on the host — this IS the restore: the shrunk cache dies with the container
  docker rm -f mongo-b21-cold
  ```
  (`BACKLINKS_PERF_COLD_CACHE_MB` sets the shrunk ceiling, default 64. The throwaway has no data
  volume, so seeding 100k pages lands in its container filesystem; lowering `BACKLINKS_PERF_PAGES` is
  fine here — the cold conclusion rests on the cache-to-working-set *ratio*, not the absolute scale.)

  - **Where the time goes:** the viewer filter, not the `distinct` — ~90% of the total. It is a
    `_id: {$in: [5k ids]}` fetch plus the grant `$or`, so it scales with the number of sources, which
    is the expected shape.
  - **Scaling:** 4x the inbound rows costs only ~1.5x latency (128 → 192 ms), i.e. sub-linear and
    still 5x under target. Extrapolating, the 1 s budget is not at risk until a hub reaches roughly
    100k inbound sources.
  - **Document size and group grants barely moved the number:** 2.3x bigger documents plus the extra
    `$elemMatch` branch cost ~1 ms (127 → 128 ms). Both were fixed because the earlier seed made the
    result *look* optimistic, not because the correction turned out to matter.
  - **Plans (all index-backed, no COLLSCAN anywhere):** `distinct` → `FETCH <- IXSCAN` on `toPage_1`;
    viewer filter → `PROJECTION_SIMPLE <- FETCH <- IXSCAN` on `_id_`; the save-path delete filter
    (`{fromPage, toPath: {$nin}}`) → `FETCH <- IXSCAN` on `fromPage_1_toPath_1`.
  - **No-rescan confirmed:** one `syncOutboundLinks` issues exactly one `bulkWrite` whose every
    operation filter is scoped to the edited `fromPage`; a sibling page's rows are byte-identical
    afterwards and the collection total moves only by that page's delta.
  - **The `distinct` is not covered, and the fix for that was measured and rejected.** It runs
    `FETCH <- IXSCAN`, not `DISTINCT_SCAN`, because its key (`fromPage`) is not in the index it rides
    (`{toPage}`) — so Mongo opens each matching row to read one field. A `{toPage, fromPage}` compound
    makes the query covered. `measurements/b21-index-cost.mjs` measures what that costs and buys
    (205k rows, A/B/A' against drift):

    | | 2 indexes | + `{toPage, fromPage}` | |
    |---|---|---|---|
    | storage | — | **+3.2 MiB** (~16 B/row; ~150 MiB at 10M rows) | modest |
    | per-save write (10 links) | 6.05 ms | **6.04 ms** | no measurable cost |
    | `distinct`, 1 row per source→target | 7.3 ms | **10.1 ms** | **44% worse** |
    | `distinct`, 3 rows per source→target | 13.3 ms | **9.0 ms** | 39% better |

    **Not added — because it makes the common case slower, not because it costs too much.**
    `DISTINCT_SCAN`'s advantage is skipping duplicate keys; when each source links a target once,
    every `fromPage` under a `toPage` is already unique, so there is nothing to skip and the wider
    index is pure overhead. It only pays when a source links the same target several ways (path +
    permalink + anchor all resolving to one page — the case B1.15 asserts is de-duplicated).

    Revisit if real wikis turn out to average ≥2 rows per source→target pair; measure that first, with
    the script above. A `{toPage, fromPage}` index also cannot serve `toPath` alone, so it does not
    pre-empt the index B4 needs.

    > Corrects an earlier note here that justified skipping the index by "per-save write cost B2.2
    > just removed". That was asserted without measurement and is wrong: the write cost is
    > unmeasurable. The real reason is the negative read effect above.

- [x] B2.2 Coalesce and pace live extraction (write-path burst control)
  - Replace the B1.6/B1.12 inline per-event extraction with an in-process coalescing queue: the
    `create`/`update` handlers mark the page dirty (`Set<pageId>`); a paced drain re-reads each
    page's latest body at drain time and runs the existing upsert handler once per page.
    `handlePageUpsertById` stays the per-page unit — the queue is the seam. Pacing is a deployment
    knob, not a constant: the coalescing window is `backlinks:drainIntervalMs`
    (`BACKLINKS_DRAIN_INTERVAL_MS`, default 1000 ms) and the share of the event loop the queue may
    occupy is `backlinks:dutyCyclePercent` (`BACKLINKS_DUTY_CYCLE_PERCENT`, default 20), both read
    at service construction and passed into the queue. A drain runs until the queue is empty,
    resting after each page in proportion to the extraction time it measured — see design.md B2.2
    for why the original per-tick page budget (`BACKLINKS_MAX_PAGES_PER_DRAIN`, 3 pages) was
    replaced after review.
  - **B2.2 scope (delete):** the drain guards against a stale upsert by re-checking status at drain
    time and declining to index a page that is now `STATUS_DELETED` — keyed on deleted rather than
    published because a legacy page's `null` status means published. That closes the window
    coalescing opened (a soft delete keeps the `_id`, so the "page is gone" check does not catch it).
    Routing the delete to `reconcileDeletedPages` and clearing the rows the page already owned needs
    the reconcile op and the delete-family handlers — deferred to **B5.2**/**B5.3**.
  - Best-effort/in-memory by design: a restart drops pending work (self-heals on next edit/backfill);
    the set is per-instance in multi-container deployments (safe because upserts are idempotent).
  - **Accepted limitation (review of B2.2):** a page whose upsert fails is retried on a later drain
    after `RETRY_BACKOFF_MS`, up to `MAX_UPSERT_ATTEMPTS` attempts; past that the queue gives up and
    logs the page at error level, and its rows stay stale until its next save or B3. The queue has a
    single drain timer, so a save arriving during a retry backoff waits for it too.
  - **Accepted limitation (review of B2.2):** an upsert that never settles leaves the drain flag set,
    and the instance then stops indexing until it restarts. Not guarded with a timeout, because a
    timeout cannot cancel the abandoned run — it would race it, and a resurrected stale run would
    overwrite a newer link set. Same repair path as any dropped work: the page's next save, or B3.
  - **Why (MongoDB impact):** every save runs `PageLink.replaceOutboundLinks`, a single `bulkWrite`
    that upserts one row per extracted link and issues a `deleteMany` for links no longer present —
    each component write maintaining every `pagelinks` index. This story also cut those from four to
    the two an actual query uses — unique `{fromPage, toPath}` and `{toPage}`; the standalone
    `{fromPage}` (already the compound's prefix) and `{toPath}` (no query until B4) were pure write
    overhead. Without coalescing, N rapid saves of one page = N full
    `bulkWrite` replaces of which N−1 are immediately obsolete, yet each still re-upserts every row,
    re-scans for the `deleteMany`, rewrites every index B-tree, and (under the `rs0` replica set)
    emits oplog entries that replicate to secondaries. A burst across distinct pages runs these
    `bulkWrite`s concurrently, contending for write tickets and collection locks with the
    latency-sensitive backlinks read (`findBacklinkSources`, a `distinct` on `{toPage}`) — so the
    write storm is what actually slows reader queries at the storage-engine level. Coalescing
    collapses same-page saves to **one** `bulkWrite` reflecting only the final link set (safe because
    `replaceOutboundLinks` is idempotent), cutting write volume, index maintenance, and oplog/
    replication traffic from N to 1; pacing then spreads distinct-page `bulkWrite`s in proportion to
    each page's extraction cost, converting an unbounded write spike into steady, bounded write QPS
    that coexists with reads. Delete must
    supersede a pending upsert because the upsert path uses `upsert: true` — running a stale upsert
    for a since-deleted page would re-create `pagelinks` rows for a non-existent source (orphan rows
    a reader could surface as phantom backlinks).
  - Done when: repeated saves of the same page within the coalescing window produce exactly one
    extraction / one `replaceOutboundLinks` `bulkWrite` (asserted via a spy/count on the upsert
    handler); a burst of distinct-page saves is paced by measured extraction cost rather than run as
    one back-to-back spree (a page costing 10x as much to extract earns 10x the rest); a source that
    is `STATUS_DELETED` at drain time is not indexed, even when the event payload still reads as
    published (no row written for it); a page whose upsert fails is retried on a later drain rather
    than dropped, and abandoned with an error log after `MAX_UPSERT_ATTEMPTS`.

## Story B3 — Backfill of pre-existing pages

**Nature:** Online, throttled, resumable, auto-started `CronService` job that populates rows for pages
that existed before the feature. Reuses the page-bulk-export scaffolding (`CronService` base,
`createBatchStream`, cursor→resume→`pipeline` skeleton, watchdog start/stop) and the B1 extractor; the
new code is the in-memory `{path→_id}` map, the `bulkWrite` upsert sink, and the atomic claim. An
admin-triggered start was deferred as a one-line future change. Independent of B4/B5.

- [ ] B3.1 Add the backfill job state model
  - Add a single-document model tracking backfill status, a progress marker (resume point), and an
    atomic-claim field so only one instance runs the job and it stops once complete
  - Done when a unit test shows the claim succeeds once and is rejected for a second concurrent claimant
  - _Requirements: 4.3_
  - _Boundary: PageLinkBackfillJob_
  - _Depends: B1.2_

- [ ] B3.2 Implement the throttled, resumable backfill job
  - Implement a cron-based job that, per tick, processes a bounded chunk of pages: build/reuse an
    in-memory path→id map (one projection query) for resolution instead of per-link lookups, extract
    links via the B1 extractor (passing the configured site URL), resolve permalink targets via an
    id-existence check against the known page ids (not the path map), and bulk-upsert rows; persist
    the progress marker after each chunk and resume from it on restart
  - Throttle via cron cadence × chunk size; skip immediately once the job document is complete
  - Done when running the job over a seeded dataset (including pages linked by permalink and by
    same-wiki absolute URL) populates rows equivalent to the live path, a re-run/resume adds no
    duplicates, and progress is emitted on the admin channel
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3_
  - _Boundary: PageLinkBackfillCron_
  - _Depends: B3.1, B1.3, B1.2_

- [ ] B3.3 Register and auto-start the backfill job
  - Register the backfill cron in server setup and auto-start it (throttled) after boot, mirroring
    the page-bulk-export watchdog start/stop; stop permanently once the job document is marked complete
  - Note: edits the same server-setup file as B1.12 — sequence after it to avoid a merge
  - Done when, after boot, the job claims and runs to completion on a fresh dataset and marks itself
    complete so it does not re-run
  - _Requirements: 4.1_
  - _Boundary: crowi setup, PageLinkBackfillCron_
  - _Depends: B3.2, B1.12_

- [ ] B3.4 Backfill tests
  - Verify backfill output matches the live path; running twice or resuming after an interrupted chunk
    produces no duplicates; the atomic claim prevents two instances/ticks double-processing
  - Done when these pass against a seeded dataset
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3_
  - _Depends: B3.2_

- [ ] B3.5 Index the descendants of a recursive duplicate
  - Gap found in review of B2.2. A recursive duplicate bulk-inserts the copied descendants
    (`PageService.duplicateDescendants` → `Page.insertMany`) and emits no per-page event, so their
    outbound links are never extracted. The duplicated **root** is already covered: it goes through
    `PageService.create`, which emits `create`. Not fixable inside this feature — `duplicate` carries
    the *source* page and fires *before* `duplicateDescendantsWithStream` runs, so the copies do not
    yet exist and their ids are never published.
  - Note: the Elasticsearch index has the same blind spot (nothing subscribes to `duplicate`, and no
    `syncDescendantsUpdate` is emitted here), so the fix belongs in `PageService` and should be decided
    for search and backlinks together rather than worked around per-consumer.
  - Options: (a) emit a descendants-created event from `duplicateDescendants` and subscribe to it;
    (b) accept the gap and let the B3 backfill repair it, documenting that a recursive duplicate is
    not indexed until then
  - Done when a duplicated subtree's descendants appear as backlink sources in an integration test, or
    option (b) is recorded here as an accepted limitation with the user-visible effect stated
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2_
  - _Boundary: PageService (page events), PageLinkService_
  - _Depends: B1.12_

## Story B4 — Link integrity across rename / move

**Nature:** Extends resolution so inbound links survive a target's rename/move. Rename/move emit no
usable event and need none: `_id`-stable `toPage` keeps links cached before the move valid, and
redirect-following keeps links resolvable when the source is re-saved after the move. This story adds
the redirect-following half of resolution plus the re-resolve-by-path repointing. Independent of
B3/B5.

- [x] B4.1 Add redirect-chain following to resolveToPageIds
  - Extend the resolver with the redirect step deferred from B1.4: follow the redirect chain to its
    endpoint and resolve there; handle multi-hop renames (A→B→C) via the redirect endpoint lookup;
    unresolved when neither a page nor a redirect resolves (the broken case). A permalink `toPath`
    still short-circuits by id (never needs redirect-following — 5.4)
  - **Match page view's precedence**: a redirect on the path outranks a live page at it, because
    `resolvePathAndCheckIdentical` follows the redirect without checking for a live page at the
    requested path. So the chain is looked up for **every** path in one lookup, not only for the
    ones that missed — a live hit does not settle the answer
  - Add the lookup as a new `PageRedirect.retrievePageRedirectEndpointsBatch` static and
    re-implement the existing singular `retrievePageRedirectEndpoints` over it, so the
    `$graphLookup` pipeline and deepest-hop rule exist once and page view cannot disagree with the
    link index about where a chain ends. Keep the depth cap a **parameter**: the save path passes
    50, page view passes none (a cap there turns a much-renamed page's old URL into a not-found)
  - Done when tests cover single and double redirect chains resolving to the endpoint, a redirect
    winning over a live page at the same path, the unresolved case, several paths resolving in one
    lookup, converging chains keyed by input, a cycle advancing one hop rather than hanging, an
    uncapped walk running past the save path's cap, and a trashed target resolving through its trash
    redirect rather than reading as broken
  - _Requirements: 1.9, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4_
  - _Boundary: resolveToPageIds, PageRedirect (batch static)_
  - _Depends: B1.4_

- [x] B4.2 Implement the re-resolve-by-path sync operation
  - Implement the row op deferred from B1.5: re-resolve inbound rows matching a given path (to repoint
    stale caches when a page appears at that path)
  - **Not only exact `toPath` matches.** B4.1 made resolution follow the redirect chain, so a row
    naming `/old` resolves here whenever `/old` redirects here — and it goes stale on the same event.
    Walk back from the path (`PageRedirect.retrieveFromPathsRedirectingTo`) to nominate candidates,
    then let `resolveToPages` decide where each one lands: a longer chain can carry a candidate past
    this path, so the reverse hop must never supply the target itself
  - Done when tests show inbound rows for a path get their `toPage` repointed when a page resolves
    at that path. The service's forwarding (which target it hands to the write) is unit-tested; the
    resulting row state is integration-tested against a real collection, since that is the
    observable contract
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2_
  - _Boundary: page-link-sync, PageLink_
  - _Depends: B1.2, B4.1_

- [x] B4.3 Wire re-resolve into the create handler
  - Extend the B1.6 create handler to re-resolve inbound matches (`reResolveByToPath(page.path)`)
    after replacing outbound rows, so links that previously pointed at this path (from a prior
    occupant or a broken state) are corrected when the page is (re)created at it
  - Done when a unit test shows creating a page at a path repoints inbound rows that referenced that path
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2_
  - _Boundary: PageLinkService_
  - _Depends: B4.2, B1.6_

- [ ] B4.4 Integration tests (rename/move)
  - Cover: inbound links survive a target's rename/move (including descendant moves) with **no index
    writes** — resolution + `_id`-stable cache keep them valid; a permalink-based backlink keeps
    resolving after its target is renamed/moved with no index writes (5.4)
  - Done when these scenarios pass against the wired service through real rename/move operations
  - _Requirements: 1.9, 5.1, 5.2, 5.4_
  - _Depends: B4.3, B1.12_

- [ ] B4.5 Bound how many chains one redirect lookup walks
  - Deliberately deferred out of B4.1 (judged out of that PR's scope), and independent of
    B4.2–B4.4 — pick it up at any point after B4.1.
  - B4.1 capped the *depth* of a chain (`maxDepth: 50` from the save path) but nothing caps the
    *width*: `retrievePageRedirectEndpointsBatch` receives every link path on the page, and B4.1's
    precedence decision means it receives them on **every** save rather than only the ones that
    missed. `$graphLookup` is memory-bound at 100MB and cannot spill to disk, so a page carrying
    thousands of links (generated content, imported trees) can fail the aggregation outright — the
    same failure mode the depth cap was added to prevent, reached through width instead.
  - **Why it matters more than the raw failure**: `PageLinkService.onUpsert` catches and logs the
    error without acting on it, so the page's `PageLink` rows silently stop being updated on that
    save and every save after it. There is no signal in the UI and no retry.
  - Fix: chunk `fromPaths` inside the static (one aggregation per chunk, results merged into the same
    map) so the caller cannot exceed the bound by passing a large set. Keep the chunk size a
    constant in the model, next to the reason — callers should not have to know it.
  - Consider covering `removePageRedirectsByToPath` in the same pass: it walks the graph the other
    way and is also unbounded, though it runs on delete rather than on save.
  - Done when a unit or integ test shows a `fromPaths` set larger than the chunk size resolves every
    input in more than one aggregation, with the same result as a single-chunk run

  - _Boundary: PageRedirect (batch static)_
  - _Depends: B4.1_

## Story B5 — Broken / trashed link handling on deletion

**Nature:** Adds the delete-family reconcile, the derived target-state (`trashed`/`broken`), the
forward-link-health read, and the UI that surfaces it. Restore needs no write — derived state reads
the restored page's status. Independent of B3/B4.

> **B5.9 is numbered out of sequence on purpose.** It was added after B5.1–B5.8 were written, to fill
> the API/hook gap between the B5.4 server read and the B5.6 panel, and is listed below in its
> dependency position (after B5.4) rather than at the end. B5.5–B5.8 keep their numbers because
> already-completed B1 tasks cross-reference them by number; renumbering would break those
> references.

- [x] B5.1 Add the delete-side model primitive and target-state derivation
  - **The model is Prisma, not Mongoose** (B1.2's text is superseded — see its note). So this is not
    a mongoose static: it is a method in the `Prisma.defineExtension` block in
    `server/models/page-link.ts`, alongside `replaceOutboundLinks` / `findBacklinkSources` /
    `repointInboundLinks`
  - **Named `removeLinksForPages(pageIds)`, not `reconcileDeletedPages`.** Like its two siblings the
    primitive is named for its mechanism and writes unconditionally; the trashed-vs-gone *decision*
    is B5.2's service op, which keeps the name `reconcileDeletedPages`. Same split as
    `syncOutboundLinks` / `replaceOutboundLinks` and `reResolveByToPath` / `repointInboundLinks`
  - Two writes, one per direction: delete the gone pages' outbound rows (`fromPage $in ids`) first —
    they have lost their source and are what a reader could surface as a phantom backlink — then null
    every inbound cache pointing at them (`toPage $in ids` → `toPage: null`). **No new index** —
    both filters ride indexes that already exist via
    `migrations/20260901064500-add-indexes-to-pagelinks.js` (`fromPage_1_toPath_1` by prefix,
    `toPage_1`)
  - **The two halves cannot share an API.** The delete is `deleteMany` through the Prisma query API.
    The inbound null **must** be `$runCommandRaw` + `throwOnWriteErrors`: `pagelinks.updateMany`'s
    generated data input accepts only `toPath` (relation scalars are not settable through it, nor via
    the relation), **and** `utils/prisma.ts`'s client-wide `$allModels.updateMany` extension injects
    `v: { increment: 1 }`, which this prisma-only collection has no field for. Any query-API update on
    `pagelinks` is therefore a `PrismaClientValidationError` — verified against the database, since no
    `v`-less prisma-only model had ever been updated before. Not a transaction (derived cache,
    idempotent halves, standalone-MongoDB compatible — the trade `replaceOutboundLinks` documents)
  - Implement `deriveLinkTargetState` (`toPage == null` → `broken`, outranking any status passed
    alongside; target status `deleted` → `trashed`; else `normal`, including a `null`/`undefined`
    status, which is a v4-era published page) — state is derived, never stored. It lands in a pure
    `server/services/link-target-state.ts` on the **read** path, not in `page-link-sync`: nothing on
    the write path derives this, and B5.4 consumes it inside the target query it already issues
  - **Declare the `LinkTargetState` union here** (deferred from B1.1) in `interfaces/backlink.ts`, in the
    shape the design's § Data Models DTO section specifies
  - Done when unit tests cover the derived states from `toPage`/target status, and an integration test
    shows the primitive removes the outbound rows and nulls the inbound caches for a batch of page
    ids while leaving unrelated rows alone
  - _Requirements: 6.1, 6.2, 6.3_
  - _Boundary: pagelinks Prisma extension (page-link.ts), link-target-state.ts, interfaces/backlink.ts_
  - _Depends: B1.2_

- [ ] B5.2 Implement the reconcile-deleted sync operation
  - Implement the reconcile op deferred from B1.5: reconcile a deleted page by checking its current DB
    state — still trashed → no-op (derived state shows trashed); truly gone → delegate to B5.1's
    `removeLinksForPages` (which removes the outbound rows and nulls inbound `toPage` → broken).
    This op keeps the name `reconcileDeletedPages` because it owns the decision; the model primitive
    it calls is named for the write
  - **Carried over from B2.2:** delete must supersede a pending coalesced upsert. B2.2 only stops the
    drain from writing *new* rows for a page that is now `STATUS_DELETED`; the rows the page already
    owned when it was trashed are still there, so this op is what actually settles them. The upsert
    path uses `upsert: true`, so a stale upsert for a since-gone page would re-create rows for a
    non-existent source — orphan rows a reader could surface as phantom backlinks.
  - **Raised in review of B5.1 — pass the batch through, do not accumulate it.** `removeLinksForPages`
    sends all of `pageIds` in one command, so an unbounded array would approach MongoDB's 16MB command
    cap and be rejected whole. This op must hand it the ids of the event payload it was called with and
    nothing more; it must not collect ids across events/batches into one call. That is safe because
    every recursive delete path funnels through `createBatchStream(BULK_REINDEX_SIZE)` (100) before the
    delete-family events fire. The primitives stay unchunked on purpose — see design.md § *Batching is
    the caller's job* for the posture and for what would flip it
  - Done when unit tests show reconcile no-ops a trashed page and nulls inbound `toPage` for a
    permanently-gone page, a delete landing while an upsert is pending ends in the reconciled
    state rather than a re-created row, and the op issues one `removeLinksForPages` call per event
    payload rather than an accumulated id list

- [ ] B5.3 Implement the delete-family lifecycle handlers
  - Implement the service handlers deferred from B1.6: delete/deleteCompletely/syncDescendantsDelete
    all route to the state-based reconcile. Idempotent; tolerate already-removed pages
  - Also drop the page id from `PageLinkUpsertQueue`'s dirty set here, so a pending upsert is
    abandoned rather than merely declined at drain time (the queue side of B5.2's carried-over
    criterion)
  - Done when unit tests invoke each handler with a fake event payload and assert the resulting row
    changes (removed/nulled)
  - _Requirements: 3.3, 6.1, 6.2_
  - _Boundary: PageLinkService_
  - _Depends: B5.2, B1.6_

- [ ] B5.4 Implement the forward-link-health read query
  - **Declare the `ILinkTarget` DTO here** (deferred from B1.1) in `interfaces/backlink.ts`, in the shape
    the design's § Data Models DTO section specifies — `targetState` required, **`pageId` nullable**
    (`string | null`). A `broken` row *is* `toPage == null`, so there is no page id to report; the
    original `pageId: string` was unsatisfiable for exactly the case this read exists to surface
  - Implement `findForwardLinkHealth` (a page's outbound rows whose derived target state is
    trashed/broken, mapped to `ILinkTarget`) in a new `server/services/find-forward-link-health.ts`,
    sibling to `find-backlinks.ts`; derive target state via B5.1's helper from `toPage`/target status
    rather than a stored flag
  - **Filter the targets through the shared viewer/grant filter.** `ILinkTarget` returns the
    target's `path`, and B4.1 made resolution follow the rename chain, so a `toPage` can point at a
    page that has since moved somewhere the viewer cannot read. Without this filter the endpoint
    leaks private paths to anyone who can read the linking page. `findBacklinks`' filter is on the
    *source* pages and does not cover this
  - **One query, not two round trips.** Deriving `trashed` needs the target's `status` and the leak
    fix needs the targets grant-filtered — the same documents — so issue a single
    `PageQueryBuilder(Page.find({ _id: { $in: targetIds } }))` + `addViewerCondition(user)` +
    `.select('_id path status')` and derive from its result. `broken` rows need no lookup at all
  - **Do not reuse `buildVisibleSourcesQuery`**: it calls `addConditionToExcludeTrashed()`, and
    trashed targets are precisely what this read reports. Add a sibling builder that applies the
    grant condition only and selects `status` too
  - Two shape rules the mapping must follow: `path` is the **target page's current path** for a
    trashed row but the row's **own `toPath`** for a broken one (no page exists; and `toPath` is text
    the linking author wrote, so it leaks nothing); and a **non-null `toPage` missing from the query
    result is omitted, never reported as broken** — "unreadable" and "gone" are indistinguishable
    there, and a truly permanently-deleted target becomes broken via B5.2's reconcile instead
  - A row whose own source is the target caches `null` (B4.2 clears it so a stale target cannot
    survive as a phantom backlink), so it reads as `broken` although the path resolves. Do **not**
    report it as a broken link — it is transient and `dropSelfLinks` removes the row on the source's
    next save
  - Done when an integration test shows forward health reports trashed/broken targets with the correct
    state, that a broken row carries `pageId: null` and its `toPath` as `path`, **and** that a target
    the viewer cannot read is omitted (distinct from a broken one), **and** that a self row is not
    reported as broken

- [ ] B5.9 Expose forward-link health over the API and the client hook
  - **Closes the gap between B5.4 (server read) and B5.6 (panel).** B5.4 produces `ILinkTarget[]` and
    B5.6 renders it, but nothing carried it across the wire: the B1 endpoint returns
    `{ backlinks }` only and `useSWRxBacklinks` resolves to `IBacklink[]`. Without this task B5.6 has
    no data source
  - **Extend the existing `GET /_api/v3/page/backlinks`, do not add a second route.** Same `pageId`,
    same viewer, same 403 semantics, and the panel renders both sections together — a separate route
    would cost a second round trip per panel open, a second hook, and a second registration in
    `apiv3/index.js`, with no independent cacheability. Add `linkTargets: ILinkTarget[]` to
    `IBacklinkResponse` and have the handler call `findBacklinks` and `findForwardLinkHealth`
    concurrently (`Promise.all`) so the added field costs no extra latency
  - Widen `useSWRxBacklinks` to return `IBacklinkResponse` instead of `IBacklink[]` (keep the
    existing key and plain `useSWR` — grants change under a stable key, so it must stay revalidating).
    `BacklinksPanel.tsx` is the only production consumer (verified), so the breaking call-site change
    is absorbed by B5.6; the hook's own `backlinks.spec.tsx` and `BacklinksPanel.spec.tsx` mock the
    old return shape and are updated here
  - No new route registration and no new requirement: 6.4 already requires surfacing the indicator,
    and 1.1/2.1 already govern this endpoint
  - Done when an integration/route test shows the endpoint returns both `backlinks` and `linkTargets`
    for a readable page (with the same 400/403 behavior as before), a viewer who cannot read a target
    sees it omitted from `linkTargets` while `backlinks` is unaffected, and the hook test shows the
    response object is returned and revalidates on page-id change

    that flags trashed/broken outgoing links from the forward-health read
  - Reads `linkTargets` off the B5.9 hook payload. B5.9 widens the hook's return type from
    `IBacklink[]` to the whole response, so the incoming-list call site changes here too — deliberate
    churn placed in the task that is already rewriting this panel, not an unplanned break of B1.11

- [ ] B5.8 Integration + E2E tests (delete/broken states)
  - Integration: deleted page is no longer an active source; trash → trashed; permanent delete →
    broken; restore → normal. E2E: an editor viewing a page that links to a trashed/deleted target
    sees the trashed/broken indicator for outgoing links
  - Done when these scenarios pass against the wired service through real trash/delete/restore
    operations and the E2E indicator flow passes
  - _Requirements: 3.3, 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4_
  - _Depends: B5.7, B5.6_
