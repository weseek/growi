# Research & Design Decisions

## Summary

- **Feature**: `backlinks`
- **Discovery Scope**: Complex Integration (new server-side index woven into existing page
  lifecycle, permission, rendering, and migration subsystems)
- **Key Findings**:
  - GROWI has **no** links/backlinks infrastructure today; link handling is render-only.
    A new server-side link index (`PageLink`) is required, closely mirroring the
    `PageTagRelation` model precedent.
  - The existing remark/rehype link-resolution plugins (`relative-links`,
    `pukiwiki-like-linker`, `relative-links-by-pukiwiki-like-linker`) are **Node-compatible**
    and already resolve every link form (Markdown, wiki-link, raw HTML `<a>`) against a
    per-page base. Server-side extraction can reuse this exact pipeline, so the index sees
    the same links the renderer does — no second parser to drift.
  - The page lifecycle exposes a ready-made **event bus** (`crowi.events.page`, a Node
    `EventEmitter`). The search service already subscribes to it the way the backlinks index
    will, so no edits to `PageService` are needed.
  - Permission filtering is solved: `Page.findByIdsAndViewer(ids, user, groups)` applies the
    same grant `$or` condition (`generateGrantCondition`) used everywhere else.

## Research Log

### Link extraction — can it run server-side, and what is reusable?

- **Context**: Requirements 1.2–1.4 demand recognizing Markdown, wiki-link, and raw-HTML
  anchors that target internal pages, while excluding external URLs, in-page anchors, and
  links inside code. We must extract these server-side at save time and during backfill.
- **Sources Consulted**:
  - `apps/app/src/services/renderer/rehype-plugins/relative-links.ts:1-65`
  - `apps/app/src/services/renderer/rehype-plugins/relative-links-by-pukiwiki-like-linker.ts:1-30`
  - `apps/app/src/services/renderer/remark-plugins/pukiwiki-like-linker.ts:1-88`
  - `apps/app/src/services/renderer/renderer.tsx:111-181` (`generateCommonOptions`)
  - `packages/core/src/utils/path-utils.ts:113-122` (`normalizePath`)
  - `packages/core/src/utils/page-path-utils/index.ts:119-121` (`isCreatablePage`)
  - `apps/app/src/components/ReactMarkdownComponents/NextLink.tsx:26-35`
- **Findings**:
  - `relativeLinks({ pagePath })` walks `selectAll('a[href]')` over the **HAST** (after
    `rehype-raw` has materialized raw HTML), resolving relative hrefs against `pagePath`.
    Zero DOM/`window` dependencies → runs in Node.
  - The pukiwiki rehype variant resolves wiki-links against a **trailing-slash base** (so
    relative wiki-links resolve as children, not siblings) — the per-type relative base.
  - Code spans/blocks never produce `<a>` nodes (they become `<code>`/`<pre>` text), so
    requirement 1.4 is satisfied structurally, not by a special case.
  - `isCreatablePage()` is the same gate `NextLink` uses to decide "internal page vs.
    external/non-page" — the correct target-scope filter.
- **Implications**: Extraction is a thin terminal step on the **existing** pipeline. We build
  a server processor from the same plugins, append a collector that harvests resolved `a[href]`
  values into an accumulator, then post-filter (strip `#`/`?` via `new URL(...).pathname`,
  `normalizePath`, `isCreatablePage`, drop self, dedupe). No new parser, no AST mutation.

### Page lifecycle events — how to stay in sync without touching PageService

- **Context**: Requirements 3.1–3.3 and 5–6 require the index to react to create/update/delete.
  The design subscribes to the event bus rather than editing `PageService`.
- **Sources Consulted**:
  - `apps/app/src/server/events/page.ts` (PageEvent extends EventEmitter)
  - `apps/app/src/server/crowi/index.ts:248-255` (`this.events.page = new PageEvent(this)`)
  - `apps/app/src/server/service/search.ts:172-239` (existing subscriber precedent)
  - `apps/app/src/server/service/page/index.ts` (emit sites)
- **Findings — confirmed event payloads**:
  | Event | Payload |
  |---|---|
  | `create` | `(page, user)` |
  | `update` | `(page, user)` |
  | `delete` (soft / trash) | `(targetPage, deletedPage, user)` |
  | `deleteCompletely` | `(page, user)` |
  | `syncDescendantsDelete` | `(pages[], user)` — fires in **both** soft and complete descendant flows |
  | `rename` | `()` — no payload, and the main-page rename does not even emit |
- **Implications**:
  - A new `PageLinkService` subscribes in `crowi` setup exactly like `search.ts`.
  - `syncDescendantsDelete` cannot tell soft from complete delete from its payload. This drove
    the **reconcile-by-current-DB-state** decision below.
  - Rename emits nothing usable and needs nothing (see redirect decision).

### Permission filtering — reuse the canonical grant condition

- **Context**: Requirement 2 forbids leaking pages a viewer cannot read.
- **Sources Consulted**: `apps/app/src/server/models/page.ts:526-571` (`addViewerCondition`,
  `addConditionToFilteringByViewer`), `:808-825` (`findByIdsAndViewer`), `:1288-1325`
  (`generateGrantCondition`).
- **Findings**: `findByIdsAndViewer(pageIds, user, userGroups?, includeEmpty?, includeAnyoneWithTheLink?)`
  takes a set of ids and returns only the readable ones, auto-fetching the user's groups. It is
  the exact primitive the backlinks read path needs.
- **Implications**: Backlinks resolve `fromPage` ids → `findByIdsAndViewer` → readable pages.
  Because the filter runs **per request**, grant changes are reflected with no index writes
  (requirement 2.4).

### UI/API conventions

- **Context**: Requirements 1.1, 1.7, 1.8 need a panel and an endpoint.
- **Findings**:
  - apiv3 routes are factory functions `(crowi) => [ ...middleware, handler ]`, registered in
    `routes/apiv3/index.js`; auth via `accessTokenParser([...scopes])` + `loginRequired`;
    user on `req.user`; responses via `res.apiv3(...)` / `res.apiv3Err(...)`.
  - SWR hooks live in `apps/app/src/stores/`, pattern `useSWRImmutable(key, () => apiv3Get(...))`.
  - `PageAccessoriesModal` has a tab map (`PageAccessoriesModalContents`); a new tab plugs in.
  - `PageListItemS` / `PagePathLabel` already render a page's title+path for reuse.
- **Implications**: No new framework patterns; the feature follows established route/hook/panel
  conventions.

## Architecture Pattern Evaluation

| Option | Description | Strengths | Risks / Limitations | Notes |
|--------|-------------|-----------|---------------------|-------|
| Server-side index via event listener (**chosen**) | Extract links at save, persist `PageLink` edges, react via `crowi.events.page` | Single trust boundary; backfillable; covers every write path; no `PageService` edits | Index lags HTTP response by the async listener window (same as search) | Mirrors `search.ts` precedent |
| Client-side reporting | Browser reports rendered links | Reuses client render | Only runs on view; no backfill; server must re-validate anyway | Rejected |
| Synchronous in-line write inside `PageService` | Write index inside the save transaction | Str+ always current | Couples to `PageService`; raises save latency | Rejected |
| Derived target-state (no broken/trashed flags stored) (**chosen**) | Store only `toPage` id cache; derive normal/trashed/broken at read from target page status | `_id`-stable cache survives rename & restore with **no** write-time work | Read path must join target status | Resolves the trashed-vs-broken question |

## Design Decisions

### Decision: `toPage` is an `_id` cache; link target state is **derived**, not stored

- **Context**: Requirements 6.1–6.3 require distinguishing *trashed (recoverable)* from
  *broken (permanently gone)* targets and returning to *normal* on restore. An earlier draft
  originally proposed nulling inbound `toPage` on soft-delete and deleting `fromPage` rows.
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  1. Null `toPage` on soft-delete (the earlier draft) — collapses "trashed" into "broken", and
     makes restore require re-resolution + a restore event.
  2. Store an explicit `state` enum column, mutated on every lifecycle event — more writes,
     more event coupling, more drift surface.
  3. **Keep `toPage` pointing at the stable page `_id`; derive state at read time from the
     target page's existence/status.**
- **Selected Approach**: (3). `toPage` is only ever `null` when no page and no redirect chain
  resolves `toPath`. A soft-deleted (trashed) page keeps its `_id`, so inbound `toPage` stays
  valid and the read path reports `trashed` from the target's status; restore needs no write.
  Only **permanent** delete nulls inbound `toPage` → `broken`.
- **Rationale**: GROWI keeps `_id` across rename and trash; deriving state from the live target
  is the minimal model that satisfies requirements 5 and 6 with the fewest write-time hooks.
- **Trade-offs**: Read path must fetch target pages' status (one extra indexed lookup); in
  exchange, rename/move/restore need **zero** index writes.
- **Follow-up**: Confirm `findByIdsAndViewer` does not silently include trashed pages on the
  source side; add an explicit non-trashed filter for backlink *sources*.

### Decision: delete-family handlers **reconcile by current DB state**, not by event semantics

- **Context**: `syncDescendantsDelete` fires for descendants in *both* the soft-delete and the
  permanent-delete flows, with an indistinguishable `(pages[], user)` payload.
- **Selected Approach**: All of `delete`, `deleteCompletely`, `syncDescendantsDelete` route to
  one idempotent `reconcileDeletedPages(pageIds)` that checks each page's **current** state:
  - page still exists (trashed) → no-op (derived state covers it);
  - page truly gone → remove its outbound rows and null inbound `toPage` (→ broken).
- **Rationale**: Robust regardless of which flow emitted the event; idempotent and safe to
  re-run. Listeners run after the operation, so the DB reflects the final state.
- **Trade-offs**: One existence check per affected page; avoids brittle event-type branching.

### Decision: coalesce live extraction through an in-process dirty-set drained on a paced tick

- **Context**: Requirement 3.5. Extraction is CPU-bound (~120–140 ms per 60 KB body) and runs on
  the single JS thread. Without control, a burst of saves runs full-body parses back-to-back and
  blocks the event loop, degrading live request latency.
- **Trace evidence** (how saves actually reach the `update` event):
  - The `update`/`create` events fire only from an **explicit save** (`PageService.updatePage`
    `apiv3Put('/page')`), triggered by the Save button or Ctrl-S. There is **no client autosave**
    interval; the editor's only debounce (100 ms) drives the *preview*, not saving.
  - Under Yjs, co-editors share a **single** server-side document; continuous edits persist to the
    `yjs_writings` collection (not a Page revision) and do **not** emit `update`. So N users editing
    one large doc produce **one** `update` event per explicit save, not N concurrent extractions.
- **Selected Approach**: `create`/`update` handlers enqueue `pageId` into an in-memory `Set` instead
  of extracting inline; a paced tick drains a bounded number of ids per cycle, re-reading each
  page's latest body at drain time and running the existing upsert handler.
  - Same-page saves coalesce for free (the `Set` dedupes); the bounded per-tick drain paces parses
    for the many-distinct-pages case, yielding the loop between them.
  - A `delete`-family event removes the id from the set and routes to `reconcileDeletedPages`, so a
    stale upsert cannot re-create rows for a deleted page.
- **Rationale**: The upsert is idempotent last-writer-wins, so intermediate saves carry no
  information and collapsing them loses nothing. Pacing (not parallelism) is the right lever for
  CPU-bound work on one thread. Reuses the backfill's duty-cycle intuition.
- **Superseded in part (review of B2.2)**: the coalescing dirty-set stands, but the *bounded ids per
  tick* half was replaced by a duty cycle over measured extraction time. Measuring the real cost
  showed it spans ~700x across bodies (1.6 ms at 0.2 KiB, 8.4 ms at 3.2 KiB, 88 ms at 32.6 KiB,
  1116 ms at 333 KiB), so a page-denominated budget was simultaneously a ~2.5% duty cycle for
  typical pages and a licence for ~3.3 s of blocking for three large ones. See design.md B2.2.
- **Trade-offs**: Index trails the save by up to (tick interval × queue depth) — consistent with the
  already-async listener. The set is best-effort/in-memory: a restart drops pending work (self-heals
  on next edit or backfill), and coalescing is per-instance in multi-container deployments (safe
  because idempotent, but less dedup). A durable queue / off-thread parsing stays deferred.

### Decision: resolve `toPage` through `PageRedirect`; rename needs no write-time work

- **Context**: Requirement 5 (links survive rename/move, including descendants).
- **Selected Approach**: Resolution order — `PageRedirect.retrievePageRedirectEndpointsBatch(allPaths, 50)`
  for every path, concurrently with the live path lookup; a path with a redirect resolves at its
  chain's `end.toPath`, a path without one resolves at its own live page; else unresolved. Because
  rename keeps `_id`, existing inbound `toPage` caches stay valid; new links to the old path resolve
  via the redirect chain.
- **Rationale**: Matches what a user clicking the stale link actually experiences; keeps
  `toPath` faithful to the body. `$graphLookup` handles double renames (A→B→C) in one query.
- **Redirect before live page, for every path (revised after B4.1 review)**: page view's
  `resolvePathAndCheckIdentical` follows a redirect without ever checking for a live page at the
  requested path, so resolving the live page first would answer differently from a click whenever a
  path both holds a page and kept a redirect. Two ways to reach that state, one of them ordinary:
  - the **v5 path** deletes the redirect on create, but from a sub-operation that is not awaited and
    swallows its own failure, so a single transient failure leaves it forever (being fixed
    separately in #11683 by deleting it inside `create`, before the page is written);
  - the **v4 path** (`createV4`, taken whenever `app:isV5Compatible` is false) never touches
    `PageRedirect` at all, so on a not-yet-migrated install the coexistence is the *normal* outcome,
    not a failure case. Precedence cannot be treated as a defense against a rare failure.

  **Cost of the agreement, accepted deliberately**: the redirect aggregation cannot be limited to the
  paths that missed — a live hit no longer settles the answer — so it runs on every save (three
  concurrent queries instead of two, plus the endpoint query only for endpoints the path query did
  not already answer). This gives up the "two queries when everything resolves" property that B4.1
  review called out as a strength; agreeing with a click was judged worth more than the query. Do
  **not** restore live-page-first as an optimization: it reintroduces the disagreement, and #11683
  does not remove the need (the v4 path above stays as it is).
- **Batched on the model, not per link (revised at B4.1)**: a page commonly carries several paths
  that resolve to nothing — renamed targets, but also the ordinary habit of linking to
  not-yet-created pages — and every save re-resolves all of them. Matching with
  `$in` keeps that at one aggregation regardless of how many paths a page carries. The batch lives as a
  `PageRedirect` static (`retrievePageRedirectEndpointsBatch`) and the pre-existing singular
  `retrievePageRedirectEndpoints` — which page view uses for its "redirected from" banner — is
  re-implemented as a lookup over it. Rejected alternative: a backlinks-local batch resolver,
  which was implemented first and duplicated the `$match` + `$graphLookup` + deepest-hop logic;
  two copies can drift (a `maxDepth` cap, a collection rename) so that page view and the link
  index disagree about where a chain ends, which is exactly the invariant this feature relies on.
- **Trade-offs**: Redirect records accumulate (`removePageRedirectsByToPath` is unused) — a
  data-hygiene caveat, not a correctness one. The save path caps its walk at `maxDepth: 50`, since
  `$graphLookup` is memory-bound at 100MB and cannot spill to disk, so an unbounded walk fails the
  whole aggregation rather than degrading. **The cap is an argument, not a property of the static**:
  it was first written into the shared pipeline, which silently made page view answer a URL whose
  chain is longer than the cap with a not-found (an intermediate hop holds no live page). Page view
  therefore calls the static with no cap, and only the save path passes one.
  (`removePageRedirectsByToPath` walks the graph the other way and is also uncapped; it runs on
  delete, not on save.) **Breadth is deliberately left unbounded for now** — one aggregation takes
  every link path on the page, so a page with thousands of links sends a `$in` of that size into a
  stage that cannot spill to disk. Judged out of scope for B4.1 and deferred to **B4.5**, which is
  where the reasoning and the fix (chunk `fromPaths`) are written down.

### Decision: requirement 6.4 implies a **forward-link health** read over the same index

- **Context**: 6.4 — when an editor views a page that links to a trashed/deleted target,
  indicate it. This is the *outgoing* direction.
- **Selected Approach**: The `PageLink` table is a directed link graph. Backlinks read reverse
  edges (`toPage = X`); forward-link health reads forward edges (`fromPage = X`) and surfaces
  rows whose derived target state is `trashed`/`broken`. Both reuse the same model, resolution,
  and derived-state logic; the forward view is presented within the Backlinks panel.
- **Rationale**: One index serves both directions; no extra storage. Delivery order of the
  forward-health surface is a backlog concern (requirements doc defers ordering).

### Decision: build vs. adopt — reuse the renderer pipeline, build only the collector

- **Generalization**: Backlinks (reverse) and forward-link health (forward) are the same
  directed-edge query in two directions — modeled once as `PageLink`.
- **Build vs. Adopt**: Adopt the existing remark/rehype link plugins, `normalizePath`,
  `isCreatablePage`, `findByIdsAndViewer`, `PageRedirect`, the event bus, migrate-mongo (indexes
  only), and `CronService` + the page-bulk-export job pattern (backfill). Build only: the
  `PageLink` model, a pure `extractInternalLinkPaths` collector, the resolution helper, the listener
  service, the backfill cron + its job/claim model, one apiv3 route, one SWR hook, and the panel
  components.
- **Simplification**: No queue/worker in v1 (event listener is the seam); no stored state enum;
  no rename/restore hooks; no second Markdown parser.

### Decision: backfill is an online `CronService` job, not a boot-time migrate-mongo migration

- **Context**: Requirement 4 (backfill pre-existing pages). The initial draft put the whole
  backfill in a migrate-mongo migration. Investigation showed two problems for large-plan
  customers (instances with very many pages).
- **Finding 1 — migrate-mongo blocks boot.** GROWI runs migrations synchronously in the Docker
  entrypoint (`docker-entrypoint.ts:247`, `execFileSync`) *before* `spawnApp`, and via the
  `preserver` npm hook (`package.json:17`). A data migration ⇒ the wiki is **offline for the full
  backfill duration**.
- **Finding 2 — per-link resolution is the real cost.** Resolving one link at a time is
  `findByPath` (+ redirect `$graphLookup`) × millions of links ⇒ potentially hours. (This drove
  both the backfill's in-memory map and, later, batching the resolver itself — see the redirect
  decision above.)
- **Finding 3 — process model.** GROWI is a **single Node process**, no `worker_threads`, no job
  queue, no distributed lock; horizontal scaling = multiple containers on one MongoDB. The
  closest precedent for a heavy background job is the **page-bulk-export job** (extends
  `CronService`, streams pages, persists a progress marker, has a companion in-progress check),
  and the Elasticsearch reindex (streams, GC per batch, admin Socket.IO progress).
- **Selected Approach**:
  1. migrate-mongo creates **only the indexes** (fast, safe to block on at boot).
  2. The heavy backfill is an **online `CronService` job** modeled on page-bulk-export: chunk per
     tick (cadence × chunk = duty cycle = the throttle), resumable via a progress-marker document,
     run-once + multi-instance-safe via an **atomic Mongo claim** (`findOneAndUpdate`), progress
     over the admin Socket.IO channel.
  3. Resolution during backfill uses an **in-memory `{path → _id}` map** built from one projection
     query (hash lookups, not per-link DB round-trips); redirect-following skipped (stragglers
     self-heal on next edit/read).
- **Benchmark anchor** (measured locally on the unified parse pipeline, proxy for extraction):
  ~0.9 ms (0.5 KB) / ~4 ms (3 KB) / ~17 ms (15 KB) / ~87 ms (60 KB) per page; +30–60% for the
  full plugin chain. Central estimate ~5 ms/page. Full-speed totals (also = blocking-downtime if
  it ran at boot): ~1 min/10k, ~10 min/100k, ~50 min/500k, ~1.7 h/1M. Online throttled =
  full-speed ÷ duty cycle (e.g. 25% ⇒ ×4); ×~4 again if pages average ~15 KB.
- **Trade-offs**: backlinks are incomplete for pre-existing pages until the job finishes
  (acceptable per 4.2 — completeness only required *after* completion; new edits index instantly).
  In-process means the parse still shares the one JS thread; the duty cycle bounds but cannot
  remove that contention — only `worker_threads` could, which GROWI lacks (deferred).
- **Delivery decision (resolved)**: **auto-start** the throttled job from `crowi` setup after boot —
  no admin action, guaranteed completion. Admin-triggered start deferred (a one-line wiring change to
  add later, reusing the identical job). Implementation reuses the page-bulk-export scaffolding:
  `CronService` base, `createBatchStream`, the cursor→resume(progress marker)→`pipeline` skeleton, and
  the watchdog start/stop logic; the new code is link extraction/resolution, the in-memory `{path→_id}`
  map, the `bulkWrite` upsert sink, and an atomic claim (stronger than the bulk-export watchdog race).

### Decision: recognize permalink (`/{id}`) and same-wiki absolute-URL link targets

- **Context**: Requirements 1.9–1.11 and 5.4 (added after the first design pass) extend recognition
  to links written as page **permalinks** (`/{pageId}`) and to **absolute URLs** whose origin is
  this wiki. Requirement 1.3 redefines "external" as *different-host* absolute URLs, and 1.6 extends
  self-link exclusion to a page's own permalink.
- **Sources Consulted**:
  - `packages/core/src/utils/page-path-utils/index.ts:21-24` (`isPermalink` = `isValidObjectId(path.substring(1))`),
    `:101-121` (`restrictedPatternsToCreate` / `isCreatablePage`)
  - `packages/core/src/utils/path-utils.ts:85-97` (`removeHeadingSlash`)
  - `packages/core/src/utils/objectid-utils.ts:3-16` (`isValidObjectId`)
  - `apps/app/src/components/ReactMarkdownComponents/NextLink.tsx:15-24` (`isExternalLink`:
    `new URL(siteUrl ?? 'https://example.com')`, compares `baseUrl.host !== hrefUrl.host`, uses
    `hrefUrl.pathname`), `:48` (`useSiteUrl()`)
  - `apps/app/src/services/renderer/rehype-plugins/relative-links.ts:35-65` (skips `isAbsolute(href)`
    and anchor links; resolves relative hrefs against `pagePath`)
  - `apps/app/src/server/service/config-manager/config-definition.ts` (`app:siteUrl`, env `APP_SITE_URL`,
    default `undefined`)
- **Findings**:
  - `isCreatablePage('/{objectid}')` returns **true** (a bare ObjectId matches none of the restricted
    patterns), so a resolved permalink path survives the extraction gate and needs no special keep-rule.
  - `relativeLinks` **leaves absolute `http(s)://` URLs untouched**, so the extraction collector must
    classify absolute hrefs itself (host vs. `app:siteUrl`), mirroring `NextLink.isExternalLink`.
  - **AC 9 caveat surfaced during design**: the renderer resolves relative links against the linking
    page's *directory*, and `isPermalink` matches only an exact `/{id}` path — so `./{pageId}` is a
    permalink only from a top-level page. AC 9 was reworded to key recognition off the **resolved
    absolute path** rather than promising the `./{pageId}` syntax. (Requirements clarification, not
    a design workaround.)
- **Selected Approach**:
  - `resolveToPageIds`: permalink branch first — inputs where `isPermalink(toPath)` are resolved by
    `_id` in their own query; no path lookup or redirect-following. Such rows are `_id`-stable
    and rename-immune (5.4).
  - `extractInternalLinkPaths(markdown, pagePath, siteUrl?)`: classify each `a[href]` — absolute URL kept
    as `url.pathname` iff `siteUrl` set and same host (1.10); dropped otherwise / when `siteUrl` unset
    (1.3, 1.11); `siteUrl` is an injected param (function stays pure; the service reads `configManager`).
  - Self-permalink exclusion (1.6): drop at sync any resolved row where `toPage == fromPage` (the path
    self-link is still dropped cheaply in extraction).
  - Backfill: permalink resolution is an **id-existence check** against the `{path→_id}` map's values,
    not a path lookup.
- **Rationale**: keys recognition off the resolved path (robust to authoring form), reuses GROWI's own
  `isExternalLink` host rule for consistency with what the renderer/UI treat as internal, and keeps the
  pure extractor config-free. No schema change — `toPath`/`toPage` already model id-stable edges.
- **Trade-offs**: absolute-URL recognition requires `app:siteUrl` to be configured (1.11); host (not
  origin) comparison ignores scheme/port, matching `NextLink`.

## Risks & Mitigations

- **Index lag after save** (listener is async, not awaited) — Mitigation: acceptable for v1
  and identical to search indexing; document the window. Durable queue / off-thread parsing deferred
  (the in-process coalescing drain below is not that).
- **Write-side CPU burst** (many saves close together parse full bodies back-to-back on the single
  JS thread) — Mitigation: coalesce via an in-process `Set<pageId>`, drained on a paced tick; same-page
  saves collapse, distinct-page parses are spread over time. Naturally low-pressure given no autosave
  and one-event-per-shared-Yjs-doc. See the coalescing decision above (requirement 3.5), including
  the note on how the drain came to be paced by duty cycle rather than by a page budget.
- **`findByIdsAndViewer` may include trashed pages on the source side** — Mitigation: add an
  explicit non-trashed status filter to the backlink-source query; verify during implementation.
- **Backfill on very large wikis** — Mitigation: online throttled `CronService` job (not a
  boot-blocking migration); in-memory `{path→_id}` resolution; cursor + `createBatchStream` +
  idempotent `bulkWrite` upserts; resumable progress marker; atomic Mongo claim for
  multi-instance. See the backfill decision above.
- **Backfill CPU contention with live traffic** (single JS thread) — Mitigation: duty-cycle
  throttle via cron cadence; conservative default; admin-tunable. Full elimination needs
  `worker_threads` (deferred, no infra).
- **Redirect record accumulation** — Mitigation: none required for correctness (`$graphLookup`
  handles depth); note for future cleanup.
- **Pipeline cost per save** — Mitigation: run a trimmed processor (link plugins only, skip
  sanitize/katex/math) since we only need resolved anchors.

- `apps/app/src/server/service/cron.ts` — `CronService` base (node-cron) for background jobs
- `apps/app/src/server/service/page/index.ts` — `updatePage` emits `create`/`update` (explicit save only)
- `apps/app/src/client/components/PageEditor/PageEditor.tsx` — save triggers (Save/Ctrl-S); no autosave
- `apps/app/src/server/service/yjs/create-mongodb-persistence.ts` — Yjs state persists to
  `yjs_writings`, not a Page revision (collaborative typing does not emit `update`)
- `apps/app/src/features/page-bulk-export/server/service/page-bulk-export-job-cron/` — background
  job precedent (CronService + progress marker + in-progress check)
- `apps/app/src/server/service/search-delegator/elasticsearch.ts:602-643` — streaming bulk job
  with admin Socket.IO progress + GC-per-batch
