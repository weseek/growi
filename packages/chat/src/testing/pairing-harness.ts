// TEST INFRASTRUCTURE, NOT PRODUCTION SURFACE. Nothing here is re-exported
// from `src/index.ts` or `src/server.ts`, and the package's `exports` map has
// no wildcard subpath, so no other package can reach this module.
//
// Both roles are played with `@growi/chat`'s own public entry points only
// (`../index.js` for the contract types and the wire-shape checks,
// `../server.js` for `pairingChallengePayload`). The only thing taken from
// outside the package is `node:crypto`, and only for what this package
// deliberately does NOT own:
//   - generating test key material (`generateKeyPairSync`), and
//   - the raw Ed25519 signing/verification of pairing step 5.
// Step 5 is the one exchange that happens BEFORE any key is registered, so it
// is not an RFC 9421 signed request at all: `sign`/`verify` (and their
// covered components, nonce, and expiry machinery) have nothing to act on
// here. What step 5 signs is exactly the string `pairingChallengePayload`
// composes, and nothing else -- see `answerOwnershipChallenge` below.
//
// Storage is a plain `Map` on purpose: how each side actually persists this
// state belongs to the app-side and proxy-side sub-specs, not to this
// package. The maps here are mutated in place (unlike the rest of this
// package, which is immutable) because they stand in for a database, and
// mutation is confined to the exported functions below.
//
// The pieces are exported one per step so a later task can intercept or
// tamper at any point in the procedure; `runPairing` at the bottom is a
// convenience that composes them, not the only way in.
